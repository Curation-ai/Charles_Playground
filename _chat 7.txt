[01/11/2024, 07:34:59] ~ JB: AMZN - blow out Q3 nos and better Q4 guidance vs consensus. 

3rd qtr in a row International has had positive Operating Profit.  Margin of 3.6% is still 2% below N America, but the CFO said N American margins are achieveable over time.  Amazon is only 1% of global retail market, of which still 80-85% is in physical stores. Plenty of runway. 

AWS Operating margin (OPM) 38.1% was a new all time high and clear signs AI is paying off for Amazon.  This opm is 21% higher than google’s cloud business.  MSFT doesn’t disclose Azure’s OPM. 

100 new AI products to be released at ReInvent after thanksgiving. AWS annual innovation event in Vegas. 

AWS aims to be NVDA’s lead partner of their new chips.  AWS is seeing very strong demand for its new AI chip Tranium 2.

Services are now 57.5% of sales.  This is a very different company to the online retailer it started as. 

AWS AI is already a multi $ billion business revenue run rate, growing over 100% yoy and is growing 3x faster than AWS did at the same stage of evolution. 

Capex will be $75bn in 2024 and higher in 2025. The majority of this is for the growth of AWS. 

Remains a top pick for me.

[01/11/2024, 07:57:02] ~ Ben Finegold: It is the remainder of the $50m ATM they announced earlier in the summer. Book is filled, was done by CG not us. Waiting to hear on pricing will let people know when we do but expect it was done at market given how strong shares have been.
[01/11/2024, 07:57:52] ~ William Nutting: Thx BF guessed as much…
[01/11/2024, 08:00:08] Nick finegold: Thanks Ben . So how much cash do Aspi have now please, including convert ?  Have any plans to float off uranium enrichment business been disclosed ? Do they have a head of uranium biz yet ? These are now the next very important questions?
[01/11/2024, 08:12:28] ~ JB: QLE will be spun off after they get a permit to build an enrichment plant.
[01/11/2024, 08:12:44] ~ Ben Finegold: Cash - last reported cash was $28.2m but since then there have been these two raises so would estimate ~$80m 

Including the convert ~$105m 

Plans to list QLE still unknown aiming for H1 25 hopefully the TerraPower news gets license done and then listing can occur. 

No head of Uranium business yet but in the works ‎<This message was edited>
[01/11/2024, 08:15:10] Nick finegold: Do you and Jonathan believe that being granted a license by the South African Government is in the price ? 

I mean Can’t imagine Terra Power backing a venture without them receiving assurances a license is forthcoming . Also South African blackouts means they need more reliable power themselves.
[01/11/2024, 08:16:05] Nick finegold: Surely a licence is a “No news “ event . Timing on flotation however would set this thing on fire again
[01/11/2024, 08:19:43] ~ JB: Silex has a US permit and has a mkt cap of AUD1.2bn despite no sign of being able to enrich uranium. 

So no where near in The price. ASPI has Haleu backlog of $37bn. 

The industrial isotope business in 3-4 years will have 4 plants in Iceland with capacity for $400m of sales and over 50% EBITDA margins. 

What multiple should have be on 10x ? 15x?
[01/11/2024, 08:21:00] ~ JB: Logical, but until they have a permit, they don’t.
[01/11/2024, 09:11:47] Nick finegold: JB what makes you say Aspi has a backlog of  $37bn when they haven’t yet proven they can enrich uranium outside a lab ? I mean Terra power will promise to buy Haleu from anyone they think has shot ?
[01/11/2024, 09:12:08] Nick finegold: Do they have a PPA
[01/11/2024, 09:12:34] Nick finegold: Or a Uramium Purchase agreement is a better way of putting it ?
[01/11/2024, 09:20:41] ~ Ben Finegold: They have indicative demand but as you say it’s not real until they can commercialise. The next step in being able to prove that is the license.
‎[01/11/2024, 09:25:32] ~ GR: ‎image omitted
[01/11/2024, 09:31:09] ~ Matt H: These things usually take a lot longer than originally thought. Many lithium companies produced hydroxide in a lab or pilot plant. Scaling it up was a major problem unless you had the Chinese government subsiding your chemical plants.
[01/11/2024, 09:32:57] ~ Matt H: Often with minor metals is best to monetise when everyone else is buying the dream.
[01/11/2024, 12:21:37] ~ William Nutting: Jonathan. To play devils advocate..

AMAZON/AMZN AVOIDANCE: Yes, I see the chart but I dont get it: $15bn of net income. $25bn of operating
cashflow minus $22bn of capex and $5.5bn of stock compensation but on a cash basis they lost $3bn this
quarter. Look at the balance sheet despite all the profits this year. The balance sheet is the same, no dividend and number of shares up 2% and that is with a mid-teen tax rate (which will go to 25% to 30% over time). Vs the S&P and Nasdaq has not hurt since July not owning and to me little changes. But good to debate…

Labour’s budget will rip apart the very fabric of our economy

[04/11/2024, 06:47:45] ~ Will Meadon: “Family businesses are an antidote to the short-termism which is the blight of the British economy and of which everyone complains. Family businesses are in the blood: a shared journey between the business and the family across the generations. Britain will sorely miss them.”
[04/11/2024, 07:25:26] ~ Mark Lewis: Wait, you mean the patriotic guy who cares so much about the well being of the country that he told us all to vote for Brexit and then promptly fucked off to Singapore afterwards because Brexit was such a failure?

[04/11/2024, 07:33:04] ~ Mark Lewis: Brexit has done more to tear to pieces the fabric of the UK economy than any other policy decision of the last 100 years, and this guy told us to vote for it only to fuck off as soon as it’s inevitable failure became apparent.

But this being the UK with most of the media owned by similarly patriotic non-doms and in some cases non-UK citizens, instead of being held to account for his appalling judgement and even worse hypocrisy he is given a platform to pontificate about other people’s errors as if he were some infallible policy guru. 

The UK media is totally unserious.
[04/11/2024, 07:36:46] ~ David Haysey: Whatever the budget you can always count on the press being full of the same claque of old humbugs explaining why it’s counter-productive for rich people (especially those with commercial interests adjacent to their own) to pay taxes. This time the Private Equity crowd seem to have pulled it off.

But climate change is only going to get exponentially worse from here and it is astonishing to me to see how illiterate most of the political class globally remains on this issue. 

Check out the King and Queen of Spain being pelted with mud by angry crowds in Valencia for a taste of where we are heading while the western political class continues to act as if BAU can carry on for the next 100 years. 

And ask yourself how the UK woukd be reacting right now if 200 people had been killed in floods over the last couple of days.

Not least because the Amazon has in the last few years flipped from being a *sink for* carbon emissions to being a *source of* carbon emissions. 

And that will only accelerate  warming and hence the point in time at which we hit irreversible tipping points:

I can’t find the whole article , but this is exactly the user case you want to read about as a shareholder in terms of how they scale . No numbers mentioned but could be enormous in time . 

Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting, commented:

“If we fail to prepare, we should prepare to fail. Our NHS was already on its knees when the pandemic struck, and it was hit harder than any other comparable healthcare system.

“We cannot let history repeat itself. That’s why this historic partnership with Oxford Nanopore will ensure our world-leading scientists have the latest information on emerging threats at their fingertips.

[06/11/2024, 04:59:11] ~ William Nutting: Nutstuff said the footprint was 1980 Reagan trouncing Carter and that looks dead right thankfully. Polymarkets is 95% for Team Trump.
Trump Trade in full force: Watch $ DXY / DJT US/ Crypto/Bitcoin / the US 10yr  / USDMXN / NDX and even Oil Futures.

It looks to me like over 300 electoral votes for Team Trump. ( Peanut the Squirrel 🐿️ is +> 200%, and will live forever. Right now he’s frolicking in the Elysian Fields! ) 
I hear on the ground anecdotally that the Secret Service are mobilising extra security at Maralago. They clearly know whats coming.

The Popular vote and the House looking like they’re in the bag. Every single swing state a complete wrecking ball, the popular vote also will be won by 2% or so, not done since Bush for Republicans.
Within hours of the election my bet is that there will be a county by county map and it will ALL be red And that’s what this is about.  
“It is what it is.” All the pre. Election “its young people and Democrats I think missed the point that Democrats had a choice to not Vote for Kamala but to vote for alternatives and that is what RFK , Elon etc are/were.   
Its predictably apparently  coming down to Wisconsin, Michigan and PA. (PA odds for Trump on are at 96%, WI at 94%….)
It’s faintly ridiculous this hasn’t already been called. WI MI and PA are deliberately foot dragging and may well involve some 0300-0500 shenanigans. If Trump gets any of them he wins. I can't believe he will get Michigan because of Whitmer. 
So it's Wisconsin or PA for the win and PA is 42% counted with mostly farmland areas left to go (Trump land).
Even Illinois only has a margin of 8.6%. That’s a Dem stronghold and their margin is below 10%. Unreal!
Kamala BARELY got Virginia.
New Jersey is 5% margin for Dems with 87% counted. No way she can win the rust belt with a margin like that in a Dem stronghold like Jersey …
It is of course predictably ridiculous how long the mainstream media networks hold off on calling the states for Trump.

A good “stream” to watch…

Do we think it’s going to $100k or $150k or $250 . 

Do we buy Coinbase , the BTC miners ? Marathon , riot ? 

In other words if you listen to those that preached about the halving and look at previous halvings , BTC Ethereum etc haven’t moved at all !

You may have heard it mentionned on money of mine podcast. Latest feedback is conflicting with one source saying it has definitively cleared and is in safe hands, and another saying only Kazakh Gov approved bidders being considered. Both credible sources. @⁨~Ben Finegold⁩ might want to respond but this is clearly the overhang in the market so if it has indeed cleared its time to back up the truck.

[08/11/2024, 09:52:54] ~ Zac Bobolakis: The challenges of enforcing sales bans. It's easy to stop sales of ASML machines. Chips not so easy.
[08/11/2024, 10:00:40] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Article says minimal impact on sales. The interesting issue is how can the US enforce a ban on sales of high end chips. As discussed elsewhere, ban on oil imports from Russia had no effect other than to rewire the supply lines - commodities are mostly fungible. Chips are not quite the same, as manufacturer can identify chips and cut off customers who leak them, but pretty sure there is a business there for someone to circumvent that. Sanction busting tends to be very lucrative.
[08/11/2024, 10:04:19] ~ Zac Bobolakis: There is also a q of how much of the increase in GPU sales has been due to hoarding by third parties ahead of stricter bans coming. Does not invalidate the bullish case AI but there may be some noise along the way.

[09/11/2024, 08:17:36] ~ GR: 50bn$ return in 3 days, on a $75mio investment, ranks pretty highly in the all time RoI list...
[09/11/2024, 08:21:49] ~ JB: Dear DT,

I think we should put massive tariffs on all non US EVs. Also it would be better if all Robo Taxis are Teslas, much safer if just one make.  How many robots will the Defence Secretary want, 5m or 10m pa? How many satellites will you need to protect our great country?

With love, your resident Genius,

Elon
[09/11/2024, 08:22:52] Nick finegold: Thanks that’s all very helpful . What happens with the inflation reduction act ?
[09/11/2024, 08:23:47] ~ William Nutting: Exactly
[09/11/2024, 08:24:51] ~ JB: Tariffs replace it. Biden will get the chip act $ and other IRA $ spent asap.  If he can remember it was his 2 key policies
[09/11/2024, 08:26:24] Nick finegold: So if you are selling electric school buses to school districts that subsidy goes for the schools ? Even if all the buses are already made in the US

[09/11/2024, 08:40:57] ~ Matt H: How important is the Chinese market to Tesla’s growth and what proportion is it of its overall sales? Musk seemed to get on with the Chinese government & and has factories there. I wonder if Musk has thrown in the towel on Chinese car sales knowing he can’t compete with Chinese made EV’s in the long term. If US tariffs are slapped on Chinese products including EV’s I would expect China to retaliate end penalise Tesla. It already banned government officials using Apple. Chinese made phones are now the best selling brands.
[09/11/2024, 08:42:36] Nick finegold: If you listen to Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley he has long said that Tesla Chinese sales should be valued 0 . I am not sure the market thinks that but it’s a great point Matt .
[09/11/2024, 08:51:43] ~ Andrew Draycott: This stat tells you China is penetrated already for Tesla. Domestic sales are already 30m in china, where they are 4m in India. Hyundai just ipo’d their India subsidiary for $18b with 15% market share, India if it follows China will be a 20m unit market and the biggest delta for Tesla going forward if they get presence. One thing is for sure, byd and the Chinese will not be allowed in (they recently were forced to sell MG’s subsidiary to Mahindra)

Tesla market cap rallies by $300bn , Musk owns 13% . Musk spends $200M on the Campaign and  receives approximately$40bn in paper uplift in Tesla share price , Trump complains about rigged elections , SEC still looking into whether Musk tweets manipulate markets ! ‎<This message was edited>

[09/11/2024, 17:42:12] ~ Tagg McGurrin: Trump has loyalty issues with anyone who does his bidding, e.g. Rudy G. Countless folks have ended up in jail for him. I wonder if he will partially mute Elon now that he has what he needed from him. And doesn’t need him for re-election.  The comments above are all very good and I tend to agree but only time will tell if Trump will pivot to a more measured presidential figure or will go on a vindictive warpath and continue the antagonistic rhetoric. America has given him another shot and I sure hope he takes it seriously.
[09/11/2024, 17:43:34] ~ Tagg McGurrin: There are massive amount of people in the US that voted Harris but was happy Trump won…imagine that. So, he’s got the stage set for greatness
[09/11/2024, 18:26:54] Nick finegold: Let’s see what that looks like .
[10/11/2024, 06:44:44] Nick finegold: As the world starts to play GameStop with Crypto and realises, if everyone buys the same asset we all get rich , here is a guide to how far this rally might go . 

Historically, Bitcoin’s price has tended to rise significantly following a halving event, though this is not guaranteed. Each Bitcoin halving, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half (thus reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is introduced), has often been followed by a substantial bull run. Here’s a general overview of past trends:

	1.	First Halving (2012): After the first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin’s price rose from around $12 to nearly $1,200 over the following year, marking a nearly 100x increase.

	2.	Second Halving (2016): After the second halving in July 2016, Bitcoin’s price rose from around $650 to almost $20,000 by December 2017, a roughly 30x increase.

	3.	Third Halving (2020): After the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin’s price climbed from about $8,700 to over $64,000 by April 2021, about a 7x increase.
[10/11/2024, 06:48:10] Nick finegold: So As the market gets bigger , more capital is required to shift the price obviously . 100x to 30 x to 7x so maybe 2.5x on this one ? Takes you to $130-150k ?

[10/11/2024, 14:21:35] Nick finegold: Watch the video please . Nothing in life is certain but this could be a generational wealth creation opportunity. 

So based off the past , $120k on BTC and ethereum getting to $5000 past its old high seems possible . 

I am long both for full disclosure.
[10/11/2024, 14:22:12] Nick finegold: GameStop for crypto with the whole world involved .
[10/11/2024, 14:22:37] Nick finegold: I am sure there will be wild swings the higher we go .

[10/11/2024, 15:33:57] ~ Jacco Reijtenbagh: I don't see this. In his first term he was beholden and bound by old-fashioned GOP members. In this term these people are all gone. In addition house and senate members elected are all MAGA supporters. With Lara Trump, co-chair of the RNC, the RNC/GOP has been transformed into a MAGA party. I don't think he's a fascist, hitler type or whatsoever, but do think that people have had it completely with identity politics. The best example being the backlash against Obama for scolding black men and men in general for not wanting to vote Harris. I don't see the vindictive warpath, it didn't happen in his first term but appointing judges who are more strict with the rule of law and more open to freedom of speech will be seen as vindictive since the liberal way the law has been applied will seize to exist. Second term presidents are also less beholden since they are no longer up for re-election. They can therefore much easier implement their vision. The vision, it should be noted, is apparently a vision shared by the majority of the country in plurality and states. That people in New York, Boston, LA, SF don't agree doesn't mean its incorrect. The big cities did not like Brexit and were tone-deaf and it did happen. I can hear the arguments that Brexit was bad for the UK. Yes, but I think the UK has a substantially brighter future alone than standing with the EU, it just hasn't been shown yet. The question here becomes is Elon focused on making money for himself or wants the US and humanity better off since that helps him in more ways than one. I tend to believe the latter so some of the policies might affect his companies short-term but benefit longer-term.

[11/11/2024, 16:15:27] Nick finegold: I just bought my Aspi isotopes back at $9 having sold at $7.50 that’s how good I am ! 

I have a sneaking suspicion of the following . 

That sometimes a company grows a great business and gets a great rating . 

Other times companies  get a great rating and then grow a business. Amazon was a good example of a company that didn’t make any money for decades but eventually built an empire . 

I think due to terra powers presence Aspi may get a rating that affords it the ability to execute and raise as much capital as it needs ao that eventually it gets to do what it says it can do . 

Isotopes aren’t my strong point . Either is nuclear but both are unlikely to be disrupted and that’s saying a lot . ‎<This message was edited>

“Nation states are moving rapidly. It’s all happening much faster than expected. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve momentum is incredible. Wait and see what MICROSOFT decide. History is being made. What a time to be alive.” (DennisP) 

BITCOIN just hit $1.7trillion. Just overtook Silver as 8th most valuable asset class.
( can you name the top 7!) 

Worth collecting a few thoughts here as we are clearly Entering the “Rhino Zone” (euphoric and horny) stage now.
Raoul calls it the “banana zone”.

Retail will clearly do what they do best, buy the top and sell the bottom.( see Coinbase rankings as these are good proxys). 
I am told that many who went quiet in the middle of 2022 are now waking up and realising they've missed a good bit of the action, when it becomes a flurry I start to get a bit worried, but we are nowhere near there yet... I am also hearing v little supply on exchange! 
My BITCOIN Price Target for 2024 has consistently been $3trn, we just hit $1.7 trillion now. I think we see the next top could be around about $4.5trn. ( but honestly thats art not science). 
I have said constantly on Politics remember “Poetry vs Prose=campaigns vs policy reality”. 
It would be silly to expect complete plain sailing, but probably is good to “bask in” the glory until a January inauguration 
(tx Jonah). 
One thing I think that's important about this cycle is the divergence between Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. 
Bitcoin is clearly digital Gold with large Sovereign, Pension and Institutional buyers now coming and consistent buyers, whatever the weather, so the domino effect there should mean it continues to remain strong over the long term. 
The Rest of crypto remains highly correlated with risk assets and monetary easing / QE / speculation / gambling since tied to VC inflows and retail bank accounts / sentiment. 
So I think more and more crypto can be understood in two buckets. One will be a more steady line up, the other will remain volatile year by year.
For now BITCOIN/ ETHE/ SOLANA/ MSTR / COINBASE/ DOGE/ SUI ( RaoulP) / RAYDIUM (Nutstuff).
[11/11/2024, 19:40:34] Nick finegold: Thank you Will.

[11/11/2024, 20:06:04] Nick finegold: Let me translate Will’s latest post on bitcoin because it’s important. 

“ I am hearing there is very little supply on exchange “ 

So basically . You want to buy a Channel Hambag . You go to Channel and they have sold out . So the price of hambag goes up a lot because there are no new handbags around anywhere and they are getting harder and harder to source  . The factory that makes the hambags is running out of the materials to make the hambag so going forward they can only make half the amount they made in years gone by and demand is soaring the less available they become .

The price for Ytterbium-176, a stable isotope used primarily for producing Lutetium-177 in cancer treatments, varies widely based on availability and regional supply factors. The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Isotope Development Center (NIDC) periodically releases new batches, but specific pricing often requires a direct quote due to fluctuating production costs and market demand. For recent pricing, reports indicate it can range around 2,100 EUR per milligram in European markets; however, prices may vary internationally based on purity and isotopic form

[13/11/2024, 00:14:05] ~ Raj Shah: Re: luxury…curious for the group here if there’s anyone who may be familiar with MyTheresa (MYTE)? They did an interesting transaction a few months ago that got a bit of attention but could be game changing. Richemont had been trying to offload Yoox Net-A-Porter for a while (there is an activist in Richemont) and originally was going to sell it to Farfetch, but the latter imploded and got sold for pennies to Coupang. Now Richemont is “selling” YNAP to MYTE - in reality they are fire sale-ing it seemingly. MYTE will take on YNAP but Richemont is also throwing in 500mm EUR (!) of cash for a 1/3 stake in the combined company. Mind you MYTE’s entire market cap prior to this transaction was ~300mm EUR (!!) so Richemont is giving away the platform and paying a massive premium to own the remainder. Farfetch is the prime example of why this space has been a disaster to invest in historically (we had been short FTCH in the past) but the idea here would be that the once horrible luxury e-commerce market just went from three competitors to now just one. Haven’t dug in so curious if anyone is educated on MYTE, which actually seems to have done a good job navigating here profitably. Also if its interesting, it would come at a time when luxury is awful so there could be cyclical upside as well ‎<This message was edited>

[13/11/2024, 08:06:23] Nick finegold: For those interested this is how MS get to $500 on Tesla 

Tesla breakdown of $500 PT for those that care . 

Key 2030 assumptions underpinning our current $500 bull case:

Auto: $90/share. 8mm units (28% unit CAGR vs. FY24 base) with 20% EBITDA margin. Our current base case auto assumption of 5.7mm units by 2030 implies a 21% unit CAGR.
Energy: $85/share. 400 GWh of ESS deployed (54% CAGR through FY30) with 22% EBITDA margin. Current base case is for 280 GWh ESS deployed by 2030.
Network Services: $146/share. Recurring software and service revenue. Includes used, parts & service, F&I, charging, FSD and other services. 25mm Tesla MAUs + 5.6mm Licensees, roughly $200/month ARPU with 53 to 55% EBITDA margins.
Mobility/Ride-Share: $118/share. 1mm units in mobility fleet by 2030, 60k miles/car, $1.75/mile, 25% EBITDA margin. We assume predominantly human supervised well beyond 2030.
3rd Party Battery/Powertrain: $61/share. 3.4mm licensee units (12% non-Tesla EV penetration), $50bn revenue, 25% EBITDA margin.
Humanoids: $0/share. Our current $500 bull case includes no explicit value of robotics/embodied AI beyond the automotive form factor. Among a wide range of assumptions, each 1% of FY24 US labor that could be replaced by Tesla Optimus could be worth approximately $100/share (NPV) to TSLA shares.
Combined total company FY30 revenue of approximately $550bn with EBITDA over $140bn.
Components of $500 Bull Case

Sensitivity analysis by business line: The following exhibit shows the impact on the TSLA share price (NPV/share) by flexing our FY30 assumption across units the units. For example, in autos every 1mm units of FY30 auto sales is worth approximately $10/share to Tesla. 100 GWh of ESS deployed is worth around $20/share. Please reach out to your Morgan Stanley salesperson for our sensitivity model (included in our earnings model) to help run custom scenarios.

If anyone is interested to learn more about the coming institutionalisation of the coloured gemstone market, reach out to me directly.

We're launching a closed-end fund in Jersey with a cut-and-polish value add kicker and the world's first emerald backed token, alongside a trophy auction in Davos.

We also have stock if you want to buy and hold and have jewellery commissioned (see video above) for a serious multiple on exit or to do something fun for a loved one.

In short, if you want to take profits in gold or BTC but pivot to an alternative defensive asset class with a 10% CAGR, this is an interesting solution.

[13/11/2024, 15:20:36] Nick finegold: Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a meme-based cryptocurrency that emerged in early November 2024, inspired by a real-life pet squirrel named Peanut. Peanut gained popularity through social media, where his owner, Mark Longo, shared videos of the squirrel’s antics, amassing a significant following. The situation took a tragic turn when New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation confiscated and euthanized Peanut, citing concerns over unsafe housing conditions and potential rabies exposure. This action sparked widespread outrage online, with public figures like Elon Musk criticizing the authorities’ decision. ￼

In response to the public outcry, developers launched the PNUT token on the Solana blockchain as a tribute to Peanut. The token quickly gained traction among traders and meme enthusiasts, leading to a surge in its value. Within days, PNUT’s market capitalization exceeded $100 million, with trading volumes reaching impressive levels. ￼

The rapid rise of PNUT highlights the influence of internet culture and social media on cryptocurrency markets. However, experts caution that meme-based tokens like PNUT are highly volatile and often lack intrinsic value, making them risky investments. ￼

As of November 13, 2024, PNUT continues to be actively traded, with its price experiencing significant fluctuations. Investors are advised to approach such meme coins with caution, given their speculative nature and the potential for rapid value changes. ￼
[13/11/2024, 15:21:38] Nick finegold: PNUT now has a market cap of $750m  I believe.

[14/11/2024, 16:40:36] ~ Chris Huggins: Do we think ASPI weakness is about the MOU pointing out that a local newco will have to be created. This will require giving away 20 - 50pct of the economics (of this plant) to a BBEE partner?

[14/11/2024, 17:00:24] ~ JB: ASPI - is just starting to produce revenue. 

It is not well covered. 

I’ve just spent 3 days with them.  Each division  is swamped with demand.  The quality and depth of staff is super impressive.  The facilities are state of the art. 

The NECSA announcement today is a partnership, way better than a permit. 

All countries charge tax for this sort of stuff.   A partnership is much better.   ASPI gets to build HALEU capacity in an already regulated facility. Only 7 countries globally can enrich uranium.
[14/11/2024, 17:00:45] ~ JB: ASPI - the isotopes business is worth $50. You get the HALEU business on top.

[14/11/2024, 17:34:31] ~ Dipesh Patel: For me the news today is nice but not as relevant without a license. For me that and a forward sale of Y176 are important catalysts. Doesn't matter how many contracts or MOUs you have if you don't have a licence to make the stuff. I think when they get SA licence approval the stock will take off again meaningfully. Just a personal perspective. They've done a lot to demonstrate proof of concept but commercialisation of the offering is still all ahead of them hence the tiny mkt cap atm
[14/11/2024, 17:39:42] ~ JB: I spent 3 hours with NECSA this week. 
They are the only SA state entity to pay a ZAR51m Dividend back to the state. 

They talk about. Partnership as being key. 

This a partnership with ASPI which will last for decades.  It is better than a license or a permit. The CEO of NECSA was in Washington DC recently.  The CEO of Terra Power has flown from Seattle to SA 3x. 

NECSA excited conversion and enrichment ages ago. Hence the need for a partnership with ASPI.
[14/11/2024, 17:43:44] ~ Chris Huggins: As I understand it - this is the licence
[14/11/2024, 17:45:12] ~ JB: It is better than a license!
NECSA has the IEA approved space where ASPI build a HALEU facility.  

Who else can do this?
[14/11/2024, 17:49:34] Nick finegold: I know nothing compared to others , but it seems incomprehensible to me that Terra Power would invest without knowing the company had a lisence to produce the product which they wished  to buy . Also Gates work is South Africa is key . If you follow him closely as I do , you will know that terra powers raison D’etre is to produce abundant cheap carbon free energy . Achieve that and you can deslalinate water and the world changes , especially Africa. ‎<This message was edited>
[14/11/2024, 17:54:23] ~ Dipesh Patel: I need to read the rns again but I would assume a licence like anywhere else is separate to any contractual agreement or MOU. I would think it would come from a separate body eg Dept of Envt. Just for clarity I own and love ASPI but am just sharing that the agreements or MOUs are just that. The company still needs to get through certain hoops in SA and overseas. Not questioning that Terra or others haven't done their work and not expecting them not to get a licence. Will read the release again.

[15/11/2024, 14:28:28] Nick finegold: I would say a couple of things having bought back in very badly . The immediate catalysts are out the way , I am sure JB’s assessment of the isotope business are 100% right but many less familiar with the stock will need to see that coming through before buying . I think averaging in might be a good idea rather than a full scale leap !

The shares have caught a bid since Oct as stream of positive news flow has really validated this company’s pipeline and gene therapy technology. 

We’ve summarised some of the key takeaways from report. 
http://curationcorp-6021764.hs-sites.com/meiragtx-briefing-q324-key-takeaways

It has just won 3 FDA awards which qualify it for vouchers that, if approved, could be worth close to company’s entire market cap. Weakness across biotech this week might therefore be an opportunity.

[19/11/2024, 12:25:35] Nick finegold: Could everyone please 🙏 refrain from politics . I will write up a few rules this weekend . But essentially the fundamental idea is that we generate alpha and use the chat for news and drawing on the expertise of the club .

We’ve had a deeply political couple of weeks with US elections and 
UK budgets so I get it , but let’s use this to for publicly traded ideas 💡 , many thanks Nick ‎<This message was edited>
[19/11/2024, 13:24:16] Nick finegold: For those who follow Ouster , we met the company yesterday . They explained that outside of earnings calls they have engaged in very little IR over the past year of restructuring. That they are through that now and will start doing some conferences in the weeks ahead . They said smart infrastructure, data centre security and warehouse automation was a small part of their equation but now growing very quickly and they expect to grow at 50% + now going forward . Will require patience but through the worst . ‎<This message was edited>

[19/11/2024, 13:50:46] Nick finegold: I would say that Angus ( CEO ) is a better representative of their story than the gentleman we met who was not long on charisma or enthusiasm but very factual .

[19/11/2024, 20:07:52] Nick finegold: Kennedy’s tweet promoting alternative treatments for depression and anxiety , were a little more punchy than I think the CEO is saying publicly . Anyone standing in the way of the agenda at the “FDA can pack their bags “ small sample size but almost 100% beneficial impact for those that took the drug twice . Maybe I am missing something.
[19/11/2024, 20:09:25] Nick finegold: For those wishing to learn more about Cybin . I have no position but am thinking about buying it in view of some rather ambitious broker upgrades .

[19/11/2024, 20:10:52] ~ A: If we still live in a world where clinical trials prevail, the list of depression drugs which show good effects in early phases and completely collapse in phase 3s is very large. As bad as Alzheimer’s drugs.
[19/11/2024, 20:11:09] ~ A: But… travelling and arriving is a different proposition, so why not
[19/11/2024, 20:13:44] Nick finegold: No doubt that officially or unofficially many people are experimenting with microdosing Cybin and no doubt that many seem to registering a beneficial impact through both channels.

[20/11/2024, 16:06:23] Nick finegold: Two companies in the states that are using genomics testing to pre entirely diagnose patients with  cancer and other diseases .
[20/11/2024, 16:06:37] Nick finegold: In this sense, Natera, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTRA) and GeneDx Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:WGS) are two examples of companies providing genomic services, utilizing next-generation sequencing to power the future of precision medicine. In the last year, both companies have been delivering high returns on investment, largely outperforming the market (see image below).

[20/11/2024, 16:48:25] Nick finegold: I think the selling of Nanopore has been pretty indiscriminate and so much of the stock is locked up with long term shareholders that it doesn’t take a lot to see the stock down although they do nothing to help themselves IR wise .

Once finished will generate 30 GWs of power. The bribery allegations refer to that win amongst others. I won’t comment on the allegations except to say it’s not a conglomerate I’ve owned in 6 years and never would, but they still are well represented in MSCI India which lifted restrictions in August of this year post hindenberg’s report.

[21/11/2024, 08:11:10] ~ William Nutting: My take away ..

Amazing to remind: NVIDIA trades 5x the volume of Microsoft. 
For every $100 passive flows , $6-7 goes to Nvidia. 
A Rough breakdown of Nvidia trading volume:
10% passive 
10% levered ETFs
20% options 
Rest is humans + algos !

Amazing: NVDA **net income** this Q is more than their **revenue** in the same Q last year.

On  the “ worth watching” on numbers: even at 35X..
AR is now up 77% since Jan, & up 21% since last quarter. 
This raises concerns about potential revenue recognition issues. The sharp increase may suggest the company is booking sales before payments are secured, which could inflate earnings. ( or they are out of capacity and selling IOUs and booking sales for the quarter.)
‎[21/11/2024, 10:30:14] ~ William Nutting: ‎image omitted
[21/11/2024, 10:31:45] ~ David Haysey: 👍
[21/11/2024, 10:42:51] ~ JB: NVDA AR % sales was 50.4% this qtr.
It has been between 45% and 63% since q4-23. It is growing in line with sales and has some seasonality. 

The reason why I said it is another must read is not the Jensen hype (US CEO is bullish on his own company - no surprise - they all are) it is the insight into what AI is doing across Govts, Companes,  industries and value chains. 

TSMC remains the cheapest, super liquid way to play this mega trend.

[21/11/2024, 14:12:39] Nick finegold: That’s the next catalyst. OSI systems hit an all time high yesterday another club stock .

[21/11/2024, 23:31:02] Nick finegold: I think this may be a profit beat for EVLV US in a carefully worded statement . It certainly doesn’t feel like a company whose core business is not doing well.
[21/11/2024, 23:31:06] Nick finegold: The firm has expanded its reach in the education sector, now serving over 1,100 school buildings, an increase of more than 100 buildings. Additionally, Evolv has extended its services to over 30 new hospital buildings, totaling over 400. The company's footprint has also grown in the sports industry, with three new professional stadiums across the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball becoming customers.

Evolv's presence in the corporate sector has strengthened, with the addition of three Fortune 500 companies, bringing its service to six of the Fortune 50 and 11 of the Fortune 100 companies. The Evolv Express system has been instrumental in detecting firearms, averaging over 500 tags daily, and screening roughly 3 million visitors per day.
[22/11/2024, 07:08:40] ~ Mark: Any idea on current NAV of Phoenix Dogital Assets please….
[22/11/2024, 07:14:54] ~ GR: Its CEO and Founder may have left the group. My best guess here is that we are in double digit territory...
[22/11/2024, 07:53:59] ~ Doug: Or the current NAV on supernova digital assets (Mike Edwards) which is similarly loaded up on Solana.. ‎<This message was edited>
[22/11/2024, 07:55:44] ~ GR: Yes, that is one asset only, Solana
Which is doing pretty well 

But matket cap is tiny
[22/11/2024, 08:38:17] Nick finegold: Phoenix , is probably 8-9p . They used to have a ton of ethereum which hasn’t done as well as BTC so it maybe a little lower than people think. Bixby will buy as many shares as anyone wants to sell at the market price ( unsurprisingly)
[22/11/2024, 08:40:33] Nick finegold: On supernova , once again , it’s probably close to double what it’ is on the screen .  They own Phoenix 30m shares solana £6m and something called streaks . I spoke to Mike last week and he will talk to shareholders in a few weeks . Hope this  helps , Nick
[22/11/2024, 08:50:10] ~ Doug: Thanks Nick
[22/11/2024, 08:51:24] ~ Dipesh Patel: Is YCA going through a similar, but non-crypto NAV discount situation and worth a look? Could be a 40% trade in it back to >£7.50? I see URA and UEC trading at their highs, but YCA is still not far off recent lows. It owns and stores uranium, not entirely dissimilar to Phoenix in crypto, and while the underlying has moved up materialy, YCA hasn't really. It may be suffering UK small cap syndrome or possibly affected by supply re Russian sanctions. I own a small position for full disclosure. Not sure how exposed they are to any Russian blockages for delivery of URA they have purchased. Co will provide an operating update end December.
[22/11/2024, 08:57:26] ~ Ed Farquhar: Last published NAV was 6.41 a share I think when spot pricewas 83.. current uranium price has fallen to 78.6.
[22/11/2024, 08:58:31] ~ Ed Farquhar: Utilities aren’t buying at the moment
[22/11/2024, 08:59:39] Nick finegold: I think that term prices ie the price at which they contract with large utilities is a  better guide of where spot is going and that will be above the current spot price . Maybe 85 from having spoken to Ben if that helps . ‎<This message was edited>
[22/11/2024, 09:01:34] ~ Ben Finegold: Feels like the equities are decoupling a bit from the spot price in particular. We saw the spot price fall $3 this week and equities rallied across the board. Cameco +5% yesterday. 

Market is paying more attention to term finally. This is real utility demand and yes we believe the Kazakh-China deal last month was signed at a significant premium to the current term price of $81. 

This price is reported monthly so will know next week and let the group know.

I think physical funds are a great trade at the moment. Would prefer SPUT personally.

[22/11/2024, 11:12:28] ~ Charles Bendon: If there is interest, I’m sure michael Alkin from Sachem cove would be happy to do a 101 on uranium for the chat. Short term trading in uranium is insanity but you’ll get a lot of comfort from him in medium / long term. Let me know and I’ll ask.
[22/11/2024, 11:17:46] ~ Ben Finegold: The uranium godfather!
[22/11/2024, 11:18:30] ~ Ben Finegold: I have heard him speak many times but would never pass on an opportunity to hear him again.

I think the club would benefit greatly from a chat with him. It’s a yes from me!

[22/11/2024, 12:27:00] Nick finegold: Merck’s oncology king Keytruda rose to the top last year, adding yet another feather in its cap. With more than 30 indications across various cancer types and stages, the PD-L1 inhibitor shows no signs of stopping.
[22/11/2024, 12:28:23] Nick finegold: Immutep . A company that’s talked to the club released data that ( phase 2 ) that shows its increased Keytruders performance by about 50% when the two are combined . ‎<This message was edited>

Satoshi found a method to store value without a trusted intermediary. Bitcoin is not just a little bit better than
Visa, but funding a replacement for storing value makes it a $450 trillion use case worth $10 trillion a year.
Bitcoin represents the transformation of our capital from financial and physical assets to digital assets. Bitcoin
is an asset without the financial risk of currency, stocks, and bonds or the physical risk of real estate or
property. This makes it digital capital (not currency). Digital capital has no tax, tenants, weather, corrosion,
regulator, etc. Digital capital is invisible, indestructible, immortal, teleportable, programmable, divisible, etc. It
is better than owning any building in New York, not even thinking about Moscow or any third-world country
(store of value) asset. This is the solution to global capital, and it is why all the capital in the world will flow into
the Bitcoin network. If you want to be wealthy forever, where would you put your money? Bitcoin is backed by
power. Bitcoin is the most powerful crypto network in the world, having 220 million holders. Bitcoin is
emerging as the dominant digital monetary network. Bitcoin is now the world's most recognised, widely held,
interesting, and compelling investment asset. Gold was the best idea in the 19th century– now it is dead
money. When people understand Bitcoin better, the 1-3% portfolio allocation will soon be more than 10-20%.
Bitcoin is a digital commodity, an asset without an issuer backed by digital power. Between 2024 and 2045, the
digital transformation will bring in $500 trillion of prosperity, including $280 trillion of Bitcoin, $350 trillion of
digital equity, $170 trillion of digital bonds, and $50 trillion of digital currency. Digital real estate and digital art
could each be $10 trillion. The Bitcoin Act of 2024: Trillions in 20th century physical and financial capital will
flow into the Bitcoin network, primarily benefiting the United States. It would strengthen the dollar and
protect the USD's status as the world’s reserve currency. The U.S. establishes, owns, and controls the world’s
reserve capital network. Any movement away from UST will flow into Bitcoin, assuring U.S. economic power.
Attract capital from around the world into the U.S., creating jobs, power, and prosperity. The financial impact
could be enormous as the U.S. can print money, take the Bitcoin bet, and, worse case, print cash for free, but
the 1 million Bitcoin Strategic Reserve proposal could lower the deficit from $54 trillion in 2035 to $32 trillion
by 2024 as the value of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin reserve increases to $17 trillion of value. The historic
precedents for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve are Manhattan in 1626, Louisiana in 1803, California in 1848, and
Alaska in 1867.
The idea is simple: determine where the value will be, buy it, and hold it forever. Bitcoin is the manifest
destiny of the Trump administration. It is the greatest deal of the 21st century that would be worth $3 trillion if
the U.S. holds its current Bitcoin, or $16 trillion if they implement the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act, which sees
the U.S. buying an additional 1 million Bitcoins over 5 years. If the U.S. does this, every other country has to
follow. The more aggressive, the more certain it could be.”

[22/11/2024, 18:43:36] Nick finegold: It’s a very good counter to the idea that BTC has no store of value and it explains how it can liberate , the flow of money in thousands user cases . I guess that’s what revolt did , make everything a damn site easier and friction free .

[22/11/2024, 19:10:42] Nick finegold: That’s a very cool video Gustavo thanks for posting. Is BTC going to halve , of course it is and has on several occasions . The point is so has every other asset class at some stage.

What he is saying it’s an asset not a currency . An asset that isn’t subject to profit warnings or the weather or a bad CEO . It’s a compelling argument .

Betting that it will difficult to get hold of Bitcoin and Microstrategy has loads of Bitcoin and maybe price jumps from 100.000 to 200.000 (squeeze/short squeeze in a day as example.

[25/11/2024, 16:11:05] ~ Philip Donald: I agree it is not in interests of a stable democracy….my point is that is perhaps the  tipping point that might move us either a) towards the Swiss model ( the country in the world that is ‘happiest ‘ with its government ) or b) where the vox pox neuters the ability of a government to govern ?…come to think of it , that maybe all started with the Brexit referendum.

[25/11/2024, 16:28:20] ~ Matthew Cyzer: Clarion call indeed. I read it too. Made a lot more sense than I anticipated and the social media arguments make total sense to me.
[25/11/2024, 16:43:17] ~ Philip Donald: on a rather different note…but quite possibly the most amazing thing I have read this year.    For the first time, says New Atlas, mosquitos have been used to deliver a malaria vaccine rather than the disease itself. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine genetically modified the single-celled plasmodium falciparum parasite that hides in the salivary glands of female mosquitos and causes the deadly disease following a bite. After somehow finding volunteers to test the method – getting bitten up to 50 times – the pointy-headed parasitologists showed that a remarkable 90% of those inoculated in this way had developed immunity to the disease. The hope is that the technique will lead to widespread vaccination programmes without the need for refrigerated supply chains, sterilised needles and trained medics….WOW!
[25/11/2024, 16:50:42] ~ David Haysey: We’d fight like rats in a sack if referenda were a regular thing here. The poison sown by the last one is still with us. Incidentally one of these absurd online petitions for a second referendum on said subject got over six million votes and caused barely a ripple politically. Hopefully this one will be roundly ignored too.

[26/11/2024, 07:32:34] Nick finegold: Churn at an all time low 2.7% , enterprise client revenues up 6-7%  are the key takeaways. 

So why is it becoming so sticky when video conferencing is bundled into Microsoft and Google for Nada is the big question ? And why are monthly active users modestly growing again . 

Well a quick read of the earnings transcript lists a group of big customers none of which I have ever heard .

Inside of MS or Google you get what your given . Inside of Zoom you have a voice , you are someone . You might even be able to suggest how they evolve their ai products to suit your business in telehealth . In other words I think Zoom is really turning into a bespoke solutions business , where for $30 a seat they will tailor their offering in certain verticals to make sure they retain big clients. ‎<This message was edited>

[26/11/2024, 13:01:38] ~ Ben Finegold: This is 5x the initial production guidance and at current prices would be ~$25m in revenues next year,
[26/11/2024, 13:06:08] ~ JB: ASPI will be the global #1 supplier of 
1. HALEU
2. ⁠Silicon 28 (as above)
3. ⁠Carbon 14
4. ⁠Ytterbium 176
[26/11/2024, 13:17:49] Nick finegold: Boring question . Do we have any forecasts for Aspi bottom line profitability over the next few years . I totally get the top down vision , but not the bottom up profit.
[26/11/2024, 13:24:18] ~ Ben Finegold: FCF breakeven should be 2025. 

Consensus revenues are:

2025 - $40m
2026 - $60m 
2027 - $100m 
2028 - $140m
2029 - $170m
2030 - $180m

We would agree with 2025 revenues but think they can beat consistently if able to continue to execute and scale ramp up of new production facilities. 

Gross margins should be thought of in the >70%, higher in places like Iceland. ‎<This message was edited>
[26/11/2024, 13:50:02] ~ JB: Is there anything more scarce than having the permission to build a HALEU plant to provide the feedstock for SMRs to power AI data centres?

Silex has one but can’t make HALEU commercially.  

Who else? 

ASPI has demand for $37bn of HALEU from just 2 customers.
[26/11/2024, 14:00:57] Nick finegold: JB , I love you , and agree with you that they have vast potential demand for Haleu. 
That’s because virtually no one in the worlds has the ability to enrich uranium at scale . 

You know far more than me about their tech but until I can better understand how they intend to commercialise their tech at scale , it’s tough for many to make that leap. The isotope side is easier to get ones head around .
[26/11/2024, 14:01:46] Nick finegold: I love the stock and own the stock ,
[26/11/2024, 14:03:33] ~ Guy Lawrence: Any idea what the estimated EBIT margins are when it hit $170/180m?
[26/11/2024, 14:03:42] ~ Guy Lawrence: As a %
[26/11/2024, 14:10:31] ~ JB: Enriching Ytterbium 176 is is a similar process to Uranium into HALEU. It actually takes much less enrichment 19.75% vs 99.75%. 

Never easy to model a company going into 1st revenues / FCF / OPM in terms of timing or production ramp.  

The 5 plants in Iceland will be much bigger as energy costs are 95% lower. 

GMs will be Pharma like.  EBITDA margins in time over 50%.

The mkt cap vs the business opportunities and scarcity of production facilities and known how is still very favourable IMHO. 

I first met Paul Mann (CEO) 20 years ago when I was at Moore and he was at MS.  He knows the science, how to run a company and how to manage market expectations (ex Soros and Highbridge).

overall funding could approach $400 million. This is the FIRST 150m with 51m going to Cadiz inc. I understand

[27/11/2024, 07:56:51] Nick finegold: Short attacks and Evolv 

Evolv US - Gun and knife crime - A core thematic pick which  we stayed with at the most difficult of times. 

Evolv US, uses touchless screens to search for guns knives and explosives , the stock fell 40% in a day because their financial accounts needed to be restated as a small amount of revenues ( $4-6m ) were booked early but were in no way fabricated. 

The CEO and FD have left the company , it was clumsy but running a public company can be complicated. .

Yesterday An FTC trade enquiry was resolved allowing a handful of schools using Evlv screens to cancel their contracts early if they are not happy with the product . This could impact 4% of ARR if EVERY contract were to be cancelled which we do not believe they all will be based on customer feedback. In addition there were no fines. 


Evlv has been subject to a short attack where the bears said their technology didn’t work despite 50 major sports franchises using their kit post rigorous trials 

Absolutely everything we have been told by the team at Stoic has turned out to be true and expect more good news going forward on new appointments that strengthen the companies governance and foundations further. 

These attacks can provide fantastic entry points and improve companies IF the core business is solid. 

These short attacks are a new dynamic in the market and can provide great entry points IF the core business is solid.

That’s what we concentrated on with Evlv US and that’s what needs to be concentrated on with asp isotopes , smci and a raft of other names that get attacked. ‎<This message was edited>

[27/11/2024, 10:41:53] ~ Dipesh Patel: Now I'm no fuzzy panda and I'm not suggesting accounting fraud over the £4.54 I paid for my chai tea latte last week (although it was daylight robbery), nor have I verified the Starbucks sites in Alaska, on the USS Harry Truman carrier, or the Robinson funeral home in South Carolina, but I am puzzled by the performance of the stock. I get that Brian Niccol comes with a great track record and I'm sure he's pitched the turnaround very well, but I can't help distance myself from the recent double digital LFL sales decline, US footfall -10% and a 25% miss on the last qtr earnings. What am I missing? Can anyone help? I appreciate we don't propose too many shorts through the club (rightly so), but SBUX feels to me like a Lulu or Nike waiting to happen after multi decade dominance. 
My inherited East African roots (no pun intended) have fueled some nerdy agricultural interests and also flagged over summer that coffee plants aren't flowering anywhere. For those not bored yet, pretty much all coffee is grown between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn in 3 regions and the critical months that have just passed can't have too much rain else the flowers for next year develop fungus. The rain has been terrible with no region unaffected. You can see that in the move in coffee pricing which is the most sensitive variable in every cup SBUX sells. For disclosure, I intend on shorting SBUX, I don't do any alpha capture systems as I have no alpha, and I am slightly nerdy about horticulture 😅. It's on 35x with downward earnings revisions. PS I'm not a coffee drinker!

[27/11/2024, 12:41:51] Nick finegold: On Aspi having watched the Paul Mann video . I have two simple observations 

1/ If the isotope business is in a state of readiness as it appears to be , investors will shortly require  a financial forecast on the mainstream business that should clearly underpin the valuation. The potential of being able to cool silicon trumps all other user cases and is fascinating . 

I have asked when forecasts will be forthcoming and the answer is that once these plants become operational there is sample testing and only post that exercise is it prudent to issue forecasts. More clarity on a timeline for when the company will provide investors with a forecast is very important. 

2/ If the nuclear tech is proprietary and not available to public scrutiny, ( which is entirely believable ) the key question then becomes have terra power seen it ? It is they not fuzzy panda that matter. 

It seems unlikely that any company would enter an MOU without some substantial DD in area such as nuclear . If they have seen it because they are part of the inner circle of nuclear energy providers , that makes the MOU very sustantive . 

Get clarity on those two issues and the rest is just noise . ‎<This message was edited>

[27/11/2024, 14:01:10] ~ Matt H: Nick on the point of MOU’s my personal opinion is that you have nothing to lose by signing one as a buyer. If as a buyer you get the product then great it will help your business. If you don’t then nothing lost. There were loads of lithium miners that had MOU’s for offtake with OEM’s  & battery manufacturers etc. A lot of them never made it into production as the lithium/nickel/cobalt price fell out of bed. An MOU to me is nice to have but not a validation.
[27/11/2024, 14:07:20] Nick finegold: I agree , Matt that’s why I wrote what I wrote , it needs some form of external validation ideally from Terra power . I guess my point is that nuclear technology is not quite like signing a PPA for electricity or lithium it’s a touch more sensitive and nuanced  , I am not sure I would put my name in something that could lead to an investment . But your point is well taken and if that’s the angle of attack that (ie the MOU is not worth the paper that it’s written on ) then anything that makes it more substantive is good and where this needs to go ultimately. ‎<This message was edited>

[01/12/2024, 17:16:39] ~ Ben Finegold: A bit of a hidden gem in the uranium space this morning 

https://on.ft.com/4eVAfKw
[01/12/2024, 17:17:33] ~ Ben Finegold: I think it could be one of the most important pieces of news for uranium this year. 

We believe that the reason contracting volumes have been lower for u3o8 is because of the conversion bottleneck. 

I.e. there is no point in contracting u3o8 until you have conversion capacity.
[01/12/2024, 17:18:47] ~ Ben Finegold: Then a second article was released today following it which is well worth reading 

https://paulomacro.substack.com/p/uranium-and-a-key-upcoming-catalyst?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=posts-open-in-app&utm_medium=email&r=1hgame&triedRedirect=true

This article correctly notes that “A 6kt expansion at Metropolis opens up just over 20mmlbs of annual U3O8 demand. Since contracting tends to be multi-year, a capacity expansion would probably see contracting for say 3 years demand. In other words the expansion could touch off 50-70mm lbs of U3O8 contracting very quickly”.

Expansions in conversion capacity will have meaningful implications for u3o8 demand and is likely the reason for this years lack of volumes. Really interesting.
[01/12/2024, 18:34:42] ~ KC Shetty: Just saw a post, that the crypto guy,  who bought a banana for some 7m$ has eaten it and is next doing a few other things.

[02/12/2024, 09:11:00] Nick finegold: A quick word on Oxford Nanopore.

Two weeks ago after a great start in the portfolio the stock collapsed from £1.60 to £1.20 . I still have no idea why,  but with so much of the free float tied up with strategic allies, one redemption or distressed seller can disproportionately impact the price. 

I wrote in our club note that it was a good time to double up, given the recent NHS deals , focus on prevention opposed to cure and comparable valuations of some genomic testing businesses in the US (whose lanes were narrower)  but whose valuations were multiples of Nanopore had caught my eye. 

Since then the stock has rallied very aggressively.  

I just think that if US buyers begin to see what we see, this things could end the year well through £2 and well through £4 at the end of next year if they can scale these healthcare relationships. The companies products are see as a research tool not a mass market diagnostic testing tool and that really needs to change. 

It’s also worth mentioning that as Nanopore rises so does the NAV of IP Group that owns 11% as they continue to buyback their shares .
[02/12/2024, 10:34:26] ~ William Nutting: Whats going on with Helium in Depin/ Blockchain World is fascinating…
I mentioned this morning and thought group here might care:  

“HELIUM: Nutstuff got bored of being told by middle aged investors (help, I sound like Greg Wallace!) “My
Discounted cash flow model doesn’t work” well, Microstrategy is now NOT alone, over the weekend $10k just
created $500m of Mkt Cap. Bitcoin Mechanics are now really working beyond pure Bitcoin. Use your Helium
mobile, you get rewarded “Mobile coin” as they map the network to augment the 5G network shortfall from
Verizon AT&T etc. those tokens you get paid just went +140% over the weekend as VZ AT&T are now
consuming data (burning HNT Token) on the Helium network, effectively 120k mobile users in the US who
wont pay a phone bill this month. As with Bitcoin and Corporates adding it to their Treasury. Start to think who
starts to buy this Telco Bitcoin (HNT Token). Its big Telco companies”
[02/12/2024, 10:38:51] Nick finegold: I think how you buy it is probably what needs as much explanation as

[02/12/2024, 10:39:23] Nick finegold: Yes .
[02/12/2024, 11:18:33] ~ Julie: Managers of ETFs designed to give leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy are being capped out by swaps providers forcing them to turn to the options markets to gain the leverage necessary (it doesn’t seem to have occurred to them up fees to slow enthusiasm for the ETFs). This delivers much less precise results -  that has introduced greater volatility and disappointed investors. The two main funds have grown to ~$5bn since launching in the summer further fuelling the rally in MicroStrategy shares.

[02/12/2024, 11:52:25] Nick finegold: I think what’s clear is that leveraged short or long bets on what is already a highly volatile asset , sets a certain number of alarm bells ringing , even if it just creates greater long term opportunity on pull backs , so some insight around that would be interesting.

Since then had Yen carry trade unwind and ASML warned for 2H-24 and 2025. 

TSMC is using their tools well. Samsung, Intel et al not so well. Hence TSMC’s 95% share in 2-5nm chips.

TSMC on 15x PE 2026
ASML on 22x PE 2026

Shares now e661.

The move back into foundries hasn’t worked.  The big 3 all use the same ASML tools yet TSMC dominates in 2-7nm chips with Intel and Samsung both floundering.  

TSMC is on 13.9x 2026 on my numbers (10% ahead of cons) for 33% CAGR. 
PEG of 0.42x. 

Still great risk reward as it moves further away from
Its peers.
[03/12/2024, 12:01:54] Nick finegold: Recent reports of a 300t “supergiant gold” discovery in China has been hitting the headlines in recent days.

Digging deeper (if you will!) into this report, we understand that based on the amount of drilling that has taken place in the region, and the presence of artisanal gold working in the region and reports of as many as 40 gold veins intersected, there is probably some merit to what has been reported.

However, while a 300t discovery is large, it is hardly huge, and we doubt very much will have any impact on the global gold market. Even if the larger suggested 1000t resource were to be proved, and a larger mine developed, it seems unlikely to produce more than 30t – approximately 1 million ounces – per year. This would be an impressive mine, but small compared to global annual mine production of about 3,600tpy.
[03/12/2024, 12:02:21] Nick finegold: it would also take 10 to 15 years to mine

[04/12/2024, 07:23:01] ~ Andrew Draycott: Good question. They did the same in the Cayman Islands where western health groups are largely ineffective, and they made ebitda margins go from single digit to >40% in three years, using their own software and medics from India. They install their own systems/medics and procedures, which to put into perspective they can do a thromboenderectomy for $11k versus $250k in the states. In India they are already ramping 23 hospitals, 10 in the North and West, which are green or brownfield, so expansion there is happening anyway. My guess on spire is that rather than repatriate the dollars made in cayman, they want to put it to work on another badly run asset with secular rail winds from an over burdened NHS. What I would say is if they buy it, I would very much expect them to make it best in class.

[04/12/2024, 18:14:40] ~ Dipesh Patel: I hadn't seen the orders thanks. I worked on IP again so did look at the holdings. I get 115-138p NAV by Q125 (factoring ONT move and buyback) if they continue with the disposal rate and no extension of the buyback. It's hard to predict with no idea of uplifts on each sale, but given your earlier post on takeouts activity in general, I think you can validate an uplift assumption to disposals. I thought Lexham was just tech purchases, but Istesso is in there? I was hoping for a Phase 2 trial update rather than a part sale🤷🏽‍♂️. (I didn't like that chairman of Istesso is also MD of Life Sciences at IP, but that's just a personal perspective on conflicts). Overall, I do feel IP may just be frustrated at the NAV discount and almost running off a chunk of assets to prove the NAV ...Investments are down for 3 yrs now and buybacks in use. Another ONT would be icing on the NAV cake, though, and hopefully more likely than a chunky writedown anywhere else.

[05/12/2024, 10:05:51] ~ Mark Wharrier: Morning all! Just wanted to flag I am co-hosting a new podcast which launches today - The Business Case. Long form conversations with successful UK CEOs to understand their leadership journey, the long term strategy of their business and perhaps what the market doesn’t appreciate about their investment case.  There are so many great companies in the UK and we want to shine a light on them. We are starting with a conversation with Nigel Terrington, CEO of Paragon Banking Group PLC who is the longest serving FTSE 250 CEO and has many insights to share.  

Many more great guests in coming weeks so please sign up and do drop me a line with any feedback and guest suggestions. Thank you.

[05/12/2024, 10:17:57] ~ Giles Fitzpatrick: Is there a simple explanation for this - assuming it’s correct? 

https://x.com/kobeissiletter/status/1864471249071595525?s=48&t=LR4xE8MKg3Nh16kdgyxEEQ
[05/12/2024, 10:19:25] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Some plausible
[05/12/2024, 10:19:38] ~ Zac Bobolakis: I'll highlight two
[05/12/2024, 10:22:39] ~ Gustavo M: Earnings surprises is the most obvious
[05/12/2024, 10:22:54] ~ Zac Bobolakis: (1) companies report after close/pre open. Given on average they manage to surprise positively, this is reflected immediately in the opening price. So the open/prev close return captures most of the move
[05/12/2024, 10:26:32] ~ Zac Bobolakis: (2) Patient/smart money vs impatient money. Impatient money rushes to trade at the open and pays the wrong price. Then spends the rest of the day earning nothing or even losing money. Patient money trades more intelligently and often later in the day so they capture the overnight moves.
[05/12/2024, 10:29:02] ~ Zac Bobolakis: The conclusion is that short term (at the open) markets generally overreact.
[05/12/2024, 10:29:13] ~ Giles Fitzpatrick: Thanks Zac.
[05/12/2024, 10:39:15] ~ Zac Bobolakis: To clarify further, this doesn't mean all impatient money is dumb. There are many investor types, not just two, and some fast money (notably many algo HFT) is smart and profitable. But there is a significant group who "need" to trade at the open and the market knows how to make them pay. Being too impulsive doesn't pay.
[05/12/2024, 10:46:30] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Another way to look at it is market makers (human or algo) are price setters and they are on average smart. Impatient money are price takers. The former know that the latter dominate the opening flows and not only set prices efficiently, they set them even further to make the latter pay.
[05/12/2024, 10:46:31] ~ Chris Huggins: Interesting Zak, thx. I am doing a bit of research into this myself for a systematic strategy. Are there any decent papers / broker notes you have seen that have some hard data on the “impatient money” theory?
[05/12/2024, 10:48:02] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Hi Chris, will try to dig out, have seen some although often not actionable.
[05/12/2024, 10:49:09] ~ Zac Bobolakis: You should speak to Gustavo too, he has experience in running systematic strategies.
[05/12/2024, 10:50:23] ~ Gustavo M: Happy to chat. Please text me privately. But no, haven’t seen any papers
‎[05/12/2024, 10:53:48] ~ Chris Huggins: ‎image omitted
[05/12/2024, 10:55:42] ~ Chris Huggins: Negative number indicate prices fall, units are in multiples of mean bid/ask spread.
[05/12/2024, 10:59:22] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Yep, I see some of these are relatively low vol ETFs so if you rush to pay up at the open, you have definitely overpaid...
‎[05/12/2024, 11:34:22] ~ GR: ‎image omitted
[05/12/2024, 20:51:37] ~ Dipesh Patel: Thanks Ben. A very long read indeed! Most of it thorough and makes sense although I am not sure it addresses the real issues that should be evaluated. I appreciate it may be unpopular on this chat, but I don't think everything Fuzzy Panda wrote about is rubbish or bogus. I've certainly been getting more concerned myself prior to the short report and on seeing the recent news releases despite those sending the shares higher at the time. Happy to discuss directly. Clearly Q125 an important period for the company in terms of transparency and updates on the commercialisation of products.
[05/12/2024, 21:06:09] ~ Ben Finegold: Thanks Dipesh. I understand this is what makes a market but if the retort I sent doesn’t address the key issues from the short report I don’t know what does. I have been fortunate enough to have not been involved in a short attack in my early career but I have certainly not seen a more thorough and considered retort to a short report. 

Ultimately I agree with you - it will be revenues that refute most of the report. If anyone on here would like to understand the scale and credibility of this company I am taking 20+ investors who have signed up for J’berg investor trip in January (14-16th).

[07/12/2024, 10:26:14] Nick finegold: Thanks for sending . I have never seen anyone trying to tokenise spot uranium but then I don’t cover the space as closely as others . If there is a token backed by physical uranium and held with a legal custodian it’s very interesting as retail could impact the spot market rather than waiting for sleepy utilities to pull the trigger ? ‎<This message was edited>

[08/12/2024, 14:27:18] Nick finegold: Maybe the above post is why Apple and Nvidia have Jv’s with Oxford Nanopore ? Maybe that’s the reason bio merieux , G42 , Oracle and the Novo foundation all took stakes in the business. 

Genes need to be sequenced at scale ( apple on you phone ) , stored in the cloud ( oracle ) , then analysed / visualised using ai ( nvidia ) then the results used to change the world ( novo ) . 

They all see
It why can’t we ? If only Oxford Nanopore could tell their story the way Jensen Haung tells their story maybe the world would wake up to the opportunity rather than next quarters earnings . ‎<This message was edited>
[08/12/2024, 14:28:36] Nick finegold: Profound changes in the world of biotech in 2025 . A boom or  bust year for many.
[08/12/2024, 14:31:08] ~ A: And when all this is done - you have to have the drug technology to test the findings 

And drug delivery to specific cell types is the great rate limiting factor
[08/12/2024, 14:31:26] ~ Simon Brewer: Nick - the ceo didn't respond to come on to the Money Maze - I suspect that's a mistake -  but Greg Smith of IP is...
[08/12/2024, 14:31:58] ~ A: But… there is ONE proven drug delivery system which can stop the function of ANY gene in one cell type - hepatocytes (the liver)
[08/12/2024, 14:32:30] ~ A: And it’s right here :) 👇👇👇

https://www.etherapeutics.co.uk/
[08/12/2024, 14:32:39] Nick finegold: No it’s typical of them . Their IR and Coms remains a shambles in my opinion. I did a podcast on them and he didn’t respond to that either .
[08/12/2024, 15:14:34] ~ KC Shetty: End of the Assad era in Syria!
Assad’s Fall: The End of Syria’s Brutal Ruling Dynasty https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-08/where-is-assad-syria-s-leader-flees-damascus-ending-brutal-dynasty
[08/12/2024, 15:16:10] ~ KC Shetty: Guess above has no ramifications for markets in the short term. But to ignore it , may not be the right approach,  for longer term investors,  hence sharing it. If not appropriate, the Admin,  can delete above and my post.

🙏
[08/12/2024, 15:20:53] ~ M B: The CEO is a difficult, arrogant man (doesn’t receive criticism well) who was reluctant to IPO the business even though all his major investors including IP group and me were telling him to provide us with liquidity. He is well past his sell by date and needs to be changed. Only then will investor communications improve. The technology is very powerful but the management of the business needs a refresh with a new professional CEO who can improve the commercialisation of the product. I like the CFO who was a pretty competent healthcare analyst beforehand but he won’t be able to encourage the CEO in the right direction.
[08/12/2024, 15:51:02] Nick finegold: I think he is a scientist and has done a commendable job in getting a who’s who of incredible corporate investors . However, their messaging needs to change dramatically and it just doesn’t seem to be a priority outside of the inner sanctum of large shareholders . The shares are where they are because in large part due to his disregard for shareholders outside of those he sees as strategic . It’s a core name because something has to change and they have an enormous cash cushion. Golden share has gone , but it’s tough to see him not being protected by those big names .
[08/12/2024, 15:53:03] ~ A: It’s all a question of ambition and how much he wants to make the company be a player on the global stage. Feels too defensive to me rather than seizing the moment.
[08/12/2024, 15:54:20] Nick finegold: Well he has the shareholders and the cash to go for it , but when I see diagnostic cancer companies with market caps of 20bn it drives me crazy.
[08/12/2024, 15:54:48] ~ A: Imposter syndrome going on is my guess
[08/12/2024, 22:40:03] ~ Ben Finegold: Blackstone’s Data-Center Ambitions School a City on AI Power Strains https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-08/georgia-s-blackstone-backed-qts-data-center-hits-resistance-over-ai-power-needs
[09/12/2024, 07:14:34] Nirav Chum: Focus is clearly on energy consumption wrt AI and data centres. What about water requirements for cooling and thematics on wastewater, smart water systems? Material increases in demand for companies like XYL, VIE, MWA, BMI etc ?
[09/12/2024, 07:18:40] Nick finegold: I think a real possible bottle neck for Nvidia and the like is how quickly these data centres can get built . 

Ie how quickly the chips they manufacture can be deployed and whether supply chains across the board cope , it’s a real issue . Speaking to Northern Data it took 2 years to get their GPU’s deployed and a single component from Israel could have delayed the entire
Operation going live by 6 months .
[09/12/2024, 08:20:00] ~ Matt H: For what it’s worth sold my US funds today. S&P tracker, Russell 2000 tracker and Fundsmith
[09/12/2024, 08:21:08] ~ William Nutting: 💪💪💪
[09/12/2024, 08:59:34] Nick finegold: Michael Saylor urges the government of the United States to sell their gold, as it accounts for more than half of the country's financial reserves. Source: crypto.news https://search.app/kUntP5oz8nnWV9iE9
[09/12/2024, 09:00:08] Nick finegold: No reaction in the price today but a story we should follow closely.
[09/12/2024, 09:10:58] ~ Matt H: Trump or someone connected has said US may sell some gold to buy bitcoin. Saylor probably reiterating something that has been mentioned previously. Not sure it’s a good idea (selling a real asset for a Ponzi scheme). It’s likely Russia/China would snap up the gold in a heartbeat at the right price of course.
[09/12/2024, 09:18:49] ~ Richard Windsor: Worst case of reverse broking I have seen for some time
[09/12/2024, 09:26:01] ~ Chris Huggins: Ponzi’s fails when you run out of people to sell to.
[09/12/2024, 09:32:44] ~ Andrew Draycott: Worth noting 15% of the worlds gold or 4x the federal reserve storage is in India and is 15% of household savings, growing at an average of more than 10% per annum. People don’t even talk about it, but that demand is structural and will become the biggest delta on gold for the next decade
[09/12/2024, 09:34:53] Nick finegold: They are however a long way from that . 

I think whilst any asset only goes up if someone buys it after you , Bitcoin is much more than a ponzi scheme . It was vulnerable to that line of attack for the last decade but has now survived several colossal sell offs and the sceptics die , whilst those being born have never lived without crypto . Is a £5 note really backed by the British economy (which is massively indebted, )or just a piece of valueless paper ? 

I think Saylor over simplifies everything but his message is clear and articulate. I definitely understand why after a lifetime of valuing things something that appears to have no value is a struggle , but attention is a currency as is trust and for now BTC has that in spades otherwise we wouldn’t be taking about it x ‎<This message was edited>
[09/12/2024, 09:43:11] ~ Matt H: Oh I agree that money issued by central banks is only going one way. Gold over the years has always outperformed cash. Crypto may well be beyond a ponzi but it doesn’t stop some other fad becoming the new Bitcoin in the future. You can touch gold. It’s real. Microstrtegy is a Ponzi scheme based on another Ponzi scheme in my opinion and while both go up I am wrong. Happy to accept that.
[09/12/2024, 09:43:11] ~ Gustavo M: But perhaps there is a reason for so much gold held by Indian households: it is the country with largest population of unbanked people. The question is as the population becomes more and more banked whether they will have such appetite for gold as storage of wealth.
[09/12/2024, 09:45:13] ~ Richard Windsor: Thats a good question... In India gold ownership also has a strong cultural element.... as they become more banked I suspect the gold goes from under a mattress to a vault rather than migrates to another store of wealth... this country is also well versed with the pernicious effect of inflation...
[09/12/2024, 09:47:54] Nick finegold: I like gold because it has far more in common with BTC than most imagine. 

Both are mined , both are scarce , both use a lot of electricity, one’s the oldest currency in the world one’s the newest , both will be digital , but only 1 will be backed by a physical asset that is acknowledged in every corner of the earth and that’s where gold can align itself to the BTC frenzy
[09/12/2024, 09:49:40] ~ JB: ‎POLL:
Best performing asset for the next 3 years? One pick only.
‎OPTION: Nasdaq 100 (6 votes)
‎OPTION: BTC (6 votes)
‎OPTION: Gold (4 votes)
‎OPTION: US 10yr Govt (0 votes)
[09/12/2024, 09:51:24] ~ Andrew Draycott: Actually now has the most 80% of the population banked after digital identification and pan numbers got issued. But you are right it is cultural, for reasons Indians on this group would know far better than me

[09/12/2024, 10:05:51] ~ David Haysey: Don’t forget gold is also widely accepted as collateral in the global financial system; BTC is not (yet). This is an important bridge as and when it crosses it.

The reason I mention it is they took a look at Evolv and post the FTC’s ruling spoke to schools who are now being offered the opportunity to break their EVLV contracts and hand back the kit as part of the ruling . 

What they found made them go long not short the shares , that’s pretty powerful .

Which is why ASPI has built over 50kg worth of capacity in SA and is likely to build much more in Iceland where the energy costs are 95% lower.

QLE will have to split from ASPI as uranoum enrichment is arguably the most regulated business on earth. 

The key for me will be how quickly are the 5 Icelandic facilities up and running.  

Then HALEU commercialisation

[11/12/2024, 10:35:34] ~ JB: Autos - incentives for Nov in the US are up 30-50% yoy as the industry desperately tries to shift stock.  Inventory continues to move higher. Suspect this nails OPM and FCF.

[11/12/2024, 13:52:51] ~ Zac Bobolakis: AMD not challenging NVDA at this point. Growth is good but not outstanding and valuation broadly reflects that. Plus the rest of its business is probably slowing down. A lot of semi stocks have been doing equally poorly, notably SKH/MU who despite the HBM exposure are now looking into a dram slowdown. Dram slowdown may not be just dram. (I am leaving Samsung aside as it's had specific issues). But look at other good stocks elsewhere in the supply chain eg AMAT. Maybe all due a bounce. Disclosure: I own some AMD. I am not a semi expert, just follow the sector. RW will no doubt have something more  insightful to say.
[11/12/2024, 13:57:35] ~ Zac Bobolakis: One more thing, NVDA margins are inviting inviting competition. While many clients may have no choice but to stick with NVDA, if those who can design own chips start doing so, at least for inference, there are risks. AMD may benefit (jvs etc) or more likely may suffer.
[11/12/2024, 14:03:31] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Those who can (for own use) include Amzn, Google, Msft, Apple. Google already have them but only for their own cloud and have a stupid deal with Broadcom. If Google were more streetwise they'd be worth 2x. None if them are likely to compete with NVDA/AMD. But they only need to make for own use to cause damage. Oh, and "make" means have TSM make them. Who else.

[12/12/2024, 05:17:03] ~ William Nutting: Reality…
“Green corporate welfare never ends, at taxpayers’ expense. Government bails out wind turbine factory after demand for its blades collapsed.
Despite state aid, 50% of Vestas’ 600 workers at its Newport, Isle of Wight plant will lose their jobs. 
Government says if it had not intervened to save the Vestas factory, it was “almost certain to close”. Maybe. 
But it will be back for more. 
Meanwhile there’s talk of devoting huge chunk of Labour’s so called National Wealth Fund to massive battery-building factory. I have one word in response: Northvolt. 
The billions that are about to be squandered on Green Blob priorities (lucrative for the Blob) will be eye-watering.” ( AFN)

[12/12/2024, 14:45:09] ~ Tim: I met these guys many times, including in Denmark. The problem is they signed a lot of contracts 2018 to 2020 with very few inflation clauses and cost escalation pass through. After Putin's invasion of Ukraine the price of everything went up, especially steel, and Vestas have been stuck executing loss making business and working off these contracts. The end of this tunnel is supposed to be arriving soon but they keep guiding that EBIT margins will get back to 10%... then missing by a country mile. 

Then factor in the change in debt costs massively affecting the economics of a wind park and orders have slowed. 

Also; there have been some reworking of installed turbines on warranty at cost to Vestas, much less than Siemens Energy (Siemens Gamesa), but still a drag. 

Their maintenance revenue is +20% margins and growing in the mix, so that might support the shares at some point... 

But overall credibility is shot for the time being... 

A fall in debt costs would be quite helpful to their customers, but we are getting into second order inflation and the inflation echo. 

Overall... might be two years before things turn around for them.

[13/12/2024, 00:04:56] Nick finegold: I Spent some time last week with a Senior PM from Capital International who had just got back from visiting Novos new production facility in Europe. capital own $25bn worth of stock so had done exhaustive work . 

Unsurprisingly the new facility is the size of several football pitches . I think we need to understand that this market is not really about whether you lose 20 vs 25% of your body weight , or about potential new competitors, it’s about how much can you make because we haven’t even scratched the surface on the demand side . Very tough to impose price cuts on a product that’s in a structural supply deficit as well. 

It’s been a relatively quiet year for Novo if they turn the taps on in 2025 I think it could be a lot better .

[13/12/2024, 07:08:44] ~ David Haysey: I’d keep that bet on for now. Most polling of political opinion (as opposed to party preference) in W European democracies suggests that support for ‘hard right’ views is c15-20%. When you’ve two parties fighting over that space it’s surely the case that the real thing is better placed. To become PM from that 15-20% base needs one needs to win voters beyond this. The perceived insurgent probably has a better chance of pulling this off. Moreover NF literally controls Reform which is a plc in which he is the dominant shareholder. So he will be its candidate regardless unless he doesn’t want to be whereas Kemi B serves at the whim of a group of restless MPs and an elderly and eccentric membership. I’d be very surprised if she is leader of the opposition by the time the next election comes round.

[13/12/2024, 10:42:56] Nick finegold: This caught my eye on BTC because if the pension world starts to allocate to BTC as the article suggests that’s the next leg .
[13/12/2024, 10:42:59] Nick finegold: Bitcoin just notched another win of sorts. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, says the cryptocurrency does have a place in multi-asset portfolios—to a point, anyway. According to a BlackRock Investment Institute paper released Thursday, giving Bitcoin a 1% to 2% weighting would produce a similar share of profile risk as the Magnificent Seven tech stocks in a standard 60/40 portfolio. That’s a “reasonable range,” BlackRock proclaimed, as anything beyond 2% would sharply increase crypto’s share of overall portfolio risk. Bitcoin has been on a high since the election of Donald Trump—and his subsequent nomination of crypto fan Paul Atkins to be chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission—soaring above $100,000. Although BlackRock’s memo provides a potential blueprint for investors “who are tolerant of Bitcoin’s risk,” they nevertheless should remain wary of scams amid the digital currency’s ongoing boom. Scammers have done exceedingly well for themselves in the past year (about $5.6 billion was lost to crypto fraud in the US last year, according to the FBI), in part because so many investors think crypto is a way to get rich quick—which of course makes them easy marks. —Jordan Parker
[13/12/2024, 10:44:16] Nick finegold: Ie the concentration risk of BTC is not all that different to owning the mag 7
[13/12/2024, 12:11:06] ~ David Haysey: If you equate risk with vol (an absurd practice IMHO) that’s probably right(ish). The M7 are a bit above 20% of the MSCI World. But you make an important point; this will legitimise BTC as an asset class for a lot of trustees etc.

[14/12/2024, 12:01:09] ~ Ben Finegold: An important read for ASPI / QLE holders.



https://www.energyintel.com/00000193-ad05-de9f-a1d3-bded8c6b0000
[14/12/2024, 12:01:12] ~ Ben Finegold: Q: I did want to ask about that. Should we view the ASP deal as speculative — meaning we're open to options that get us Haleu earlier than 2030 — or do you really believe they can build capacity by then?

A: I think that'll be the fastest source. We've done due diligence there. They have the technical capabilities. They have a government lab there, Necsa [the Nuclear Energy Corp. of South Africa]. Necsa and the energy minister are both supportive of South Africa enriching uranium again, and importantly they have full IAEA protocols in place there because enrichment is a sensitive technology.

We're excited about that agreement for two reasons. One is it helped us solve this schedule issue on our first core for Natrium. But beyond that, Bill created the company to bring nuclear energy to places like Africa. So to be working in South Africa, and have our first activity in Africa with a very knowledgeable nuclear nation like South Africa, you can really see how South Africa is just our first step toward eventually deploying Natrium reactors in Africa.

[15/12/2024, 12:46:59] Nick finegold: On Aspi ,  

If you watch “innovating to zero”  on Youtube or inside Bill Gates Brain on Netflix , you will Learn that Terra Power began their journey to decarbonise the planet through reengineering nuclear technologies in 2006, by hiring the most prominent nuclear scientists , physicists  and computational experts in the world. There is probably no more credible source on the planet in the area of nuclear science than Terra power . 

To me this means their statement in support of Aspi’s technology should be taken extremely seriously by the investment community , far more so than any government. 

Centrus and Silex who are yet to scale Haleu trade at $1bn + valuations.  This statement suggests to me that Aspi has a shot at the same prize although commercialising and scaling HALEU is going to be hugely challenging and there are going to be several facilities being sponsored by the US Governmnent. 

Aspi being backed by the most credible scientific source on nuclear power is exceptionally good  news. 

Now we just need a credible financial forecast on the isotopes business at the start of next year and this bear attack will be completely put to bed . ‎<This message was edited>
[15/12/2024, 12:58:23] ~ JB: He also said ASPI will be 1st to HALEU production.

SMRs need over $200bn worth and counting.
[15/12/2024, 13:12:54] Nick finegold: Everyone understands the prize , that’s not in question . Anybody buying this stock should view Haleu as free ish  call option on the companies future but until we go further down that path we should realise that commercially producing Haleu at scale outside a lab is no slam dunk. The isotopes business is what will afford investors real protection if they are able to produce what they claim in 2025 . Only facts , not stories help this company fulfil its potential , but there  is no doubt in my mind that their governance and communication will only improve post this event , it will be an even better company post this bear attack. We await their financial forecast in the new year with great interest.
[15/12/2024, 14:49:04] ~ JB: CG broker has $30m of revs 2025

Bigger ? Is the Q4 Rev run rate
[15/12/2024, 14:53:34] Nick finegold: When I last checked the company had issued no financial forecast , because these plants are new and they had to check that the isotopes could be manufactured in the correct concentration and quantities . Is that not correct?
[15/12/2024, 14:54:52] ~ JB: CEO has said many times he is happy with consensus
[15/12/2024, 14:55:12] Nick finegold: Well then he should put out his own forecast ?

[16/12/2024, 09:02:48] ~ Robert: …and now for something completely different: my take on crypto. A week ago RUSI published a little noticed item on Russian money laundering by two criminal groups (Smart & TGR). The interesting aspect is the growing use of stable coins (Specifically Tether). This may well be a challenge for the incoming US administration - heavy criminal usage of Crypto. https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-destabilise-russia-organised-crime-and-illicit-finance?mc_cid=16dfcfaf83&mc_eid=ad4d8fb152
[16/12/2024, 09:04:32] ~ Robert: I soend a lot of time investigating financial crime for clients: follow the money always ends up in cryptoland. You buy, they (the criminals) happily sell.
[16/12/2024, 09:05:58] ~ William Nutting: Robert in your opinion how much criminal activity happens via $US vs Digital Assets today in monetary terms
[16/12/2024, 09:07:26] ~ Andrew Draycott: Would also be interesting to know the fiscal implications from tax evasion
[16/12/2024, 09:10:32] ~ Julie: FTSE Quarterly reweighting: Oxford Nanopore to enter FTSE 250 on close this Friday
[16/12/2024, 09:13:26] ~ Robert: A few years ago the UN put mi ey laundering at 2-5% of global gdp - which understates it significantly - but we eould be talking $800bn-$2000bn. I did some further work on that number and reckon today it is north of 5-8% possibly 10%. The bulk of that is USD although € denominated has grown. Crytpo analysts claim that money laundering is minimal. Too 3 illegal mkts (drugs counterfeir and people) gross $1,5 trillion pa. What analysis there is on crypto only messures activity by identified and verified criminal users.
[16/12/2024, 09:15:17] Nick finegold: I am pretty sure the Russians and everyone else in the world have been using cash and gold to money launder for ever . Any currency is prone to abuse , whether it be melted down gold or cash under the bed used to pay the Plummer although I admit keeping up with digital is going to be a challenge for every government . ‎<This message was edited>
[16/12/2024, 09:18:20] ~ Robert: Not if it is transnational. Primary usage for transnational is crypto high-end diamonds, and fine art held in storage. Ever tried moving $5mn in gold. Note the two Russian gangs shifted 13mn in 74 days just in the UK

[16/12/2024, 09:28:14] ~ William Nutting: NF, hope ok for a shout-out to for the “Sycamore Gap Tokenisation & Blockchain Infrastructure  Fund” now +110% from its July launch ( vs +60% for all digital assets mkt cap). Is FCA Regulated. 
Also a flag on something Nutstuff has been very focussed on that went through a tough time…
HELIUM/HNT: now >$10; This really is the tokenisation of a real-world asset and a real-world problem being solved by a digital blockchain solution saving major telco’s 10’s of billions of dollars of 5G Capex. This is not weirdos chasing meme coins or Fartcoins!
HELIUM/HNT: $1.6bn/ $9.35. NOW its time to keep an eye on the “Burn” = data offload to Helium network! Burn = HNT consumed out of system (price up). This is just starting to compound now and retail is nowhere near it whilst telco networks in the US are totally onboard now; 5 carriers. In my mind projects like this over the next 6 to 13 months will become very real. The “Fag packet maths” at $150k daily burn means you can be thinking about a a three digit HnT price if not more; that is once people know and understand the gamification here then “locking the higher floors” will start to set in plus institutional buyers are coming in finally. ‎<This message was edited>

[19/12/2024, 12:08:16] Nick finegold: Why UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is a Compelling Buy

Driving the news: UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a healthcare titan, faces short-term headwinds, including government scrutiny of PBMs and unexpected challenges like the atrocious murder of a divisional head. Yet, history shows these events often create buying opportunities for long-term investors in this compounder.

Why it matters:
	•	Massive market: The U.S. healthcare sector accounts for a staggering 19% of GDP and is growing.
	•	Demographic tailwinds: The U.S. population is aging rapidly, with those 65+ expected to grow from 58M in 2022 to 82M by 2050—a 47% increase.
	•	Cost pressures: Healthcare costs in the U.S. are often 50–200% higher than in other developed countries, driving the need for innovative cost-saving solutions.

By the numbers:
	•	Optum Health: Only serves 4.7M customers out of 340M U.S. residents, highlighting a vast runway for growth.
	•	Optum Insight: Operates with a 21% operating margin and a $35B backlog, or 1.6x 2024 revenues.
	•	Optum RX: Negotiated $85B in drug price savings for 2024, delivering over $2,000 in annual savings per customer.

The big picture: UNH’s integrated model, anchored by Optum, focuses on value-based care, improving outcomes, and reducing costs. Their investments in technology, home-based care, and data-driven insights position them as a leader in reshaping healthcare delivery.

Investor takeaway:
	•	Growth engine: UNH compounds EPS at 13–16% annually, yet trades at a modest 12.6x P/E (2027 estimates) with a free cash flow yield of 8.7%.
	•	Low expectations: Consensus estimates just 8% EPS growth for 2025 despite 10% revenue growth—leaving room for upside surprises.
	•	DCF value: Target price of $830 suggests significant upside from current levels.

Bottom line: With five growth pillars—value-based care, health benefits, tech, financial services, and pharmacy—UnitedHealth Group is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable, compounding returns. The recent weakness offers a rare opportunity to buy a proven compounder at a discount.

UnitedHealth Group has been mentioned above and appears to be well liked.
It has fallen from c.$600 to $500
Simple structure if you are interested in income / coupon:

Reverse Convertible on UnitedHealth Group
Issuer: Marex 
Currency: USD
Maturity: 24 month
Observation Frequency: semi annual
Barrier:  80%
Coupon 10.23%p.a


I am highlighting this coupon, because it has fallen so much in recent months.
You receive the coupon over the 24 months, semi annually.
At maturity (in 24 months) 100% of your capital is returned if the stock is not more than 20% down. Hence the 80% barrier.
At maturity : If UNH is below the 80% barrier  - the investor receives back the level of UNH ( E.g if its down 25% you receive back 75% of your capital) ‎<This message was edited>

[19/12/2024, 15:19:23] ~ Richard Windsor: its not the offer I was hoping for... and that's because the performance relative to long term commentary given 3 years ago has been very poor...
[19/12/2024, 15:20:32] ~ Richard Windsor: and so this looks like a fair offer to me... clearly the new owner will shake it up and realise the value that there is but will not be delivered with the current situation
[19/12/2024, 19:49:57] ~ Ben Finegold: https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-markets-impacted-by-market-signals-and-uncertainty/
[19/12/2024, 19:50:05] ~ Ben Finegold: The spot market is dealing with an overhang of supply as some traders look to clear their positions before the year's end. Further pressuring the spot market are rampant rumors the Kazakh ANU physical uranium fund may be liquidating its 2+ million-pound inventory. While Russia’s retaliatory export ban on enriched uranium to the U.S. pushes utilities’ focus to the nuclear fuel cycle's conversion and enrichment segments, we believe this attention will eventually cascade down to uranium oxide (U3O8). This year's muted term contracting activity, at 100.7 million pounds of U3O8e, was heavily skewed by Chinese contracts with Kazatomprom and increases the likelihood of future contracting, as deferred purchases will eventually need to be addressed. Delaying these purchases risks depleting existing stockpiles, which is an unsustainable scenario from a risk management perspective.

[20/12/2024, 07:50:49] ~ Julie: Two more quoted life sciences companies in IP Groups portfolio get cash offers – anticipated £13.8m, 20% of which will be used to increase buybacks

Intelligent Ultrasound Group - IP has a 20.8% - sold at 100% premium to last reported NAV 
And
Abliva AB – IP has a 9.5% stake – sold at 284% premium to last reported NAV
[20/12/2024, 08:12:42] Nick finegold: Can you check that please.
[20/12/2024, 08:14:29] Nick finegold: We know about IU . I think the important point is that these companies are going at a premium to a very conservative  NAV at which the shares already trade at 50-60% discount .
[20/12/2024, 08:20:19] ~ Gustavo M: Got it. Thx
[20/12/2024, 08:26:19] Nick finegold: NIKE - The new CEO’s banter on the earnings call was excellent and very exciting to listen to , the numbers were a lot less exciting . 

This quarter, revenues were down 8% on a reported basis, and down 9% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting ongoing headwinds from our franchise management actions. We continue to drive the biggest reductions to our classic footwear franchises on NIKE Direct, which was down 14% with NIKE Digital declining 21% and NIKE Stores declining 2%. Wholesale was down 4%. Gross margins declined 100 basis points to 43.6% on a reported basis, due to higher markdowns on NIKE Direct, wholesale discounts to liquidate inventory and channel mix headwinds, partially offset by lower product costs and strategic pricing actions. SG&A was down 3% on a reported basis. While we increased investment in areas such as sports marketing, this was more than offset by lower wage-related expenses and timing shifts in other demand creation expenses. Earnings per share was $0.78.
[20/12/2024, 08:27:03] Nick finegold: We shall see if he can Just do it , rather than talk about it

[20/12/2024, 11:04:02] ~ Ant: NVOs
[20/12/2024, 11:04:10] ~ Ant: now down 27%, LLY up 9%
[20/12/2024, 11:05:34] ~ Julie: might be worth noting this on Lilly https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/fda-eli-lilly-weight-loss-drug-zepbound-no-longer-in-shortage.html
[20/12/2024, 11:05:34] ~ Ant: surely this is xmas/lack of liquidity madness? market wanted 24-25% weight loss... they only managed 22.7%. am not sure my tailor could tell the difference between 75% of my current weight and 77%
[20/12/2024, 11:09:26] Nick finegold: I think the idea that the supply shortage is over when the NHS said it would take 12 years to role out these drugs to suitable candidates is right either .
[20/12/2024, 11:10:00] Nick finegold: The demand side of the equation is somewhat understated .

[20/12/2024, 11:15:18] ~ Zac Bobolakis: The idea that NOVO -20% because AWL 22.7% but would have been +10% in case AWL >25% tells more about the market than about the co/product. (I have no position in the stock)
[20/12/2024, 11:18:34] Nick finegold: Also a few conflicting reports . I suspect price and whether the drug agrees with you or not are both important . 

We are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema demonstrating superiority over both semaglutide and cagrilintide in monotherapy in the REDEFINE 1 trial. This was achieved even though only 57% of patients reached the highest CagriSema dose,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema.”

The results from the second pivotal phase 3 trial, REDEFINE 2, in adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight are expected during the first half of 2025.
[20/12/2024, 11:33:22] Nick finegold: Although obviously the company is going to put bits own slant on things .

ON kit still very tough to spot

Zeyanda magic to unfold ?
[21/12/2024, 03:22:14] ~ KC Shetty: I bought the stock,  ONON as few friends in different locations were high praise for the ON shoes, and as apparently Federer is hands on, and not just brand ambassador. Stock at all time highs but not sure what the full potential is, for coming years. 

Think it is important to understand this and few other such new brands in estimating if Nike can ever recover.  

FootLocker CEO also a name to reckon but stock is on a yo - yo, in the last year.
[21/12/2024, 04:10:31] ~ KC Shetty: They have just announced they are getting out of India. Not sure of correlation to recent stock price but a huge setback after 2 decades of partnership and with the best possible partner , The Tatas. 

They completely lost the plot and worth a case study
[21/12/2024, 06:39:51] ~ Julie: Starbuck’s is scaling back store openings in India due to rising inflation and real estate hurdles, NOT exiting the market.
 “We will calibrate for the short term — maybe instead of opening 100, we will open 80 now, and next year we will open 120 instead of 100.”

“Aviva has agreed to buy the motor and home insurer Direct Line for £3.7 billion in a move that will create one of the biggest motor insurers in the UK. Aviva will pay 275p a share, as proposed in a preliminary agreement this month, representing a 73.3 per cent premium to Direct Line's closing price before the talks began in November. The deal, which will be completed in the middle of next year, is expected to result in about 2,000 job cuts as the group eyes £125 million of cost savings.”
[24/12/2024, 08:13:04] Nick finegold: Yes I think LSEG will be a runner next year. If these products are a success they  will be integrated into MS office in time unleashing huge potential disruption and new subscriptions globally  . Ie if a super computer can do to financial services using back data , what Tesla would like to do to cars, autonomous driving and robots you may see a similar reaction in the share price of LSEG which is nicely underpinned by solid fundamentals and not really viewed as an ai stock yet . 

I have seen things beyond my wildest expectations in 2024 with the written word but have yet to see anything that has utterly amazed me in the numerous FS suites to which I subscribe. No doubt it’s coming and being built inside places like citadel and Bloomberg but 2024 has been about testing in FS and hallucinations in finance can be very expensive so it takes time . 

“Search” in financial services  is not a subject about which many have spoken . 

What I mean by that is i spend a huge amount of time trying to get from theme to stock and then screen those stocks. 

If one could search an idea for the optimal outcome in seconds it turns Financial Services on its head. 

Ie imagine saying to ChatGPT , give me the worlds purest  play on speeding up connectivity between  data centres and their users in a way that reduces costs , for the service provider and optimises the user experience . Please also screen within that group for the wall streets highest price target and rank accordingly with the cheapest valuations first . 

Also please screen for the management teams with the most successful exits and best track records of delivery over their careers . 

This is what has to be coming and LSEG has to be a front runner in that field. Easier for them to disrupt the space than Bloomberg with all its data locked inside the terminal for the time being . 

The edge risk of course is that someone does a better job with the backseat of data than laser and Microsoft , but they are unlikely to have that type of distribution .

[24/12/2024, 08:19:44] ~ William Nutting: I know some UK insurance heavyweights here. 
Beazley has been great to own in 2024, so much “2025 thought babble” that UK is “ perceived uninvestable” when alot of UK alpha; and if we dont buy UK stocks it seems many might buy themselves “… just a thought. Maybe Admiral/ ADM LN.
[24/12/2024, 08:21:57] Nick finegold: We spoke to admiral a few weeks ago they are an impressive outfit but somewhat pleased with themselves and had no interest in retail investors which was interesting . They also operate in pretty much a single lane of motor insurance .

[24/12/2024, 08:27:46] ~ Robin Maxwell: RPI - Raspberry Pi Holdings Ltd … a small point but maybe relevant for LSEG sentiment. Note the recent 40% run in RPI on new partnership news (https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/article/raspberry-pi-shares-boot-up-after-fresh-tie-up-and-new-product-launch). I have a small pos in this one … it’s encouraging to see RPI hitting all their pre IPO targets and being treated well as a result. It’s becoming a good case study and a successful example of ‘how to IPO’. Might just give that extra confidence for companies waiting on sidelines in 2025 and give that IPO green light

From yesterdays: 

A NEW NUCLEAR NUTSTUFF “spec sit” for 2025!

=LIGHTBRIDGE/ LTBR US: New ‘Spec-sit” (so tiny!) NUCLEAR name and dovetails well with ASPI US. In reality only 1 proper reactor fuel exists! CEO Seth Graeme built the Barakah Nuclear Plant in the UAE so he
understands execution & engineering. The Company are deeply imbedded with Idaho national labs. There is No sell side analyst covereage and the stock owes nobody anything. This is all about existing labs & SMR’s. 1.
Lightbridge holds the patents on metal fuel rods that will boost power output of existing nuclear plants AND
New Nuclear SMRs, BOTH in the US and globally. 2. Low execution risk. No mines to build. Extruding metal
rods is a simple process. 3. An Easy acquisition for either Centrus Energy, Westinghouse, GEH, Orano, Urenco
or Framatome. 4. Advance status at the INL and in the NRC licensing process. 5. Already working with Centrus
($LEU), the first HALEU producer also probably with ASPI / Terrapower JV.

Thankyou Charles D… 

Happy Christmas, everyone. 

A Norfolk friend writes a Christmas message to all his friends, and I thought I’d share it with you.   Happy Christmas 2024

Dear People-I-Know,

Having fun? Is life tip-top? Remember, I know you all, which is why you’re getting GLIM, because I don’t send it to people I don’t know. When I look around at you, my friends, I’d say you are a lucky lot. As am I.
Yes, of course we all have problems—the wife, the kids, the job, the mortgage, the cost of hotels in St. Barths, the inability to get a good table at the Chiltern Firehouse, the au pair’s sexual incontinence, and the difficulty of getting an Uber on a rainy Saturday night. I don’t mean to belittle any of these things; they can be really annoying.
However, when I look around at you, my friends, I see some of the luckiest people in the world, living their best lives. None of you are short of food or housing, none have been involuntarily put in a uniform like your grandparents, and, best of all, you go where you want, take nice holidays, have access to life-saving medicine, and live in nice places.
When I tell my Martian buddy who drops in from time to time to check up on Planet Earth about you, he sighs and says, “What lucky bastards they must be.” I snort and wipe the tears of laughter from my face. “How happy they must be!” he continues, completely oblivious to how awful the world is. They read the news, click on social media, and find themselves submerged in a tide of grievance, bitterness, and vice.
So here’s my advice: lighten up, look around you, and have a laugh. We should all do our best to make the world a bit happier, even if only a tiny bit. Whether it’s making a simple difference to climate change or the Ukraine war or a transgender attack or impeachment of Trump, something you do matters.
And yes, the same applies to you, the recipient of this GLIM. I know some of you have had a tough year, and I send you a virtual hug. I suspect the same will be true next year, so keep on smiling.
Sending you the happiest wishes for a frivolous and fun-filled 2025.

Gas remains a theme I'm also playing through the transportation companies - I recently added FLNG to my portfolio - they own 13 lng carriers, & from my understanding from the research have locked in high l-t charter rates. Their management appear to be very disciplined on capital allocation & dividend is c 13%. Listed on the NYSE & Oslo. I don't claim any expertise on this (I also own Golar, and the N. American Gas players, Peyto & Petrus)

[30/12/2024, 09:34:48] Nick finegold: On flex Simon it’s super interesting thankyou . 13% yields are unusual
[30/12/2024, 11:27:15] ~ Simon Brewer: I figure if you combine a handful of these names ( especially in a Sipp or equivalent tax free vehicle) I mentioned, you have optionality  for a higher gas price to feed through to earnings and a blended high yield, with most well covered even these gas prices.  Plus Europe continues to pursue an abomination of energy policies including this proposed and ludicrous new proposed law “ corporate sustainability due diligence directive “
[30/12/2024, 11:30:26] ~ Tim: Morning Simon. I do think claim to be an expert on Norwegian shipping, but went to a conference in Oslo a few years ago. My take was most companies spend the cycle cash flow negative with maybe 2 years in 8 actually making money. These 2 years have to get them through the rest. Unfunded dividends most of the time hence the high yields.

When the market tightens they all press the capex button and add supply, sending the operators back underwater. 

Struck me as crazy but I guess there is some econometrics (a beautiful mind, Russell Crow, game theory) reasons behind this.

Like you was very interested in the yields at the time.

LNG space may be different so worth a look!

He is major shareholder and senior debt holder to one of his companies. He makes large unfunded equity distributions. 
If he gets the maths wrong re cap ex/biz cycle and there is a cash crunch, then as the senior lender he takes the box seat in restructuring ….wipes out minorities, injects a bit more equity and goes again. ‎<This message was edited>

Echo all above. Some great perspectives and ideas and fun to be a part of..
Happy Healthy 2025 to all.

For those of you thinking about what is really exciting me….

AI AGENTS: ( expect the likes of Raoul to be all over this in the next few weeks). 
As alot of the larger plays in Digital assets have consolidated, December has been an incredible month for Digital Alpha, but not in the places most are anywhere near. 
A good reason why is that the entire "AI agent" space is just $13bn USD today, in a total crypto market cap of $3.5trn, hence it is just 0.4% of the market
For historical context you have essentially had 5 significant “metas“ in Digital assets / Crypto: Ethereum ICO rush of 2017, DeFi summer of 2020, NFT bananza of 2021, meme mania of 2024. 
AI agents will be the meta of 2025, and very few have portfolios prepared accordingly. AI Agents should account for 20%+ of all blockchain user transactions by the end of 2025. The space is currently 0.4% of crypto market cap, I expect it to hit 4%+ in the next 12 months. Best risk/reward I have seen in the 8 years I have been looking at this stuff. 
The upcoming key use case for AI agents will be the low hanging fruit applications in DeFi that make trading and investment allocations more seamless, we have already seen projects like ai16z, Vader, DAOS FUN, Photon, aixbt, Almanak, Wayfinder etc. capture significant mindshare. We are approaching an inflection point where crypto trading/fund management performed primarily by AI in a 24/7 playing field, will inevitably outperform human counterparts. This thesis has already been playing out in AI generated memecoins (GOAT, Fartcoin etc.)

The market is currently split into two key categories: 
1. The Infrastructure layer (Virtual/GAME, Eliza/ai16z, AI Rig Complex, Zerepy, Heurist etc.) 
2. The Agent layer (aixbt, Luna, VaderAI, Sekoia, Freysa, Duck AI etc.)

The Speed of deployment in this sector is key as most digital institutional managers are simply not able to trade the space yet (mandates have not been updated, ICs painfully slow and only a handful of assets listed on CEXs with significant liquidity/volume), the only key fund announcement so far is DWF devoting $20m to this space. (and yes the Sycamore Gap Fund can and is playing here aswell).
[31/12/2024, 13:26:40] Nick finegold: What is the minimum investment in sycamore gap ? 

I think I am going to invest simply because I can’t understand a thing you write about but know you are smart and onto something because these tokens are backed by real income. 

Love 
Nick ‎<This message was edited>
[31/12/2024, 13:30:25] ~ William Nutting: $100k. Thats honestly exactly why to. Few can do this stuff themselves. 
Am Happy to get a call together with George O for Curation even if for education. But he absolutely can explain this in a way noone else I have met ever could…
[31/12/2024, 13:31:21] Nick finegold: I don’t want a call I just want to make 10x and be able to blame you if it doesn’t work xxx
[31/12/2024, 13:31:38] Nick finegold: That’s worth money alone

(5 min read)

“Real economy names may do alright—if only because they’re so under-owned, but most equity investors are crowded in overvalued tech, and fantasy themes of dubious quality. The Everything Bubble suddenly feels highly unstable. I think 2025 will be a year that most equity investors will want to forget…”

[01/01/2025, 00:33:25] ~ Alex Fink: Happy new year everyone. Hope you all have a prosperous new year and are all suitably drunk!! 🎉🎉
[01/01/2025, 01:47:33] ~ Paul Sisson: thx Nick as always for making the club a thriving community … & for anyone interested attach a short summary of my 2025 stock pick XVIVO .. HNY to you all …                            What is Xvivo - Swedish Medtech Co, founded 1998, HQ Gothenburg & focussed on organ transplants. IPO’d 2012, #1 s’hldr Bure Equity (14%), Fourth AP 9%, Robur 8% & Capital 4%, Co has developed portable storage solutions for all 4 key organs (heart, lung, kidney & liver) that extend survival time when outside the body (Ex vivo).

Since 1st heart transplant in 1967 organs have been held in static cold storage (think coolers) with a survival time of ~4hrs. Xvivo has developed an oxygenated hypothermic (read cold) perfusion technology (aka HOPE) that uses a  nutrition & blood substitute solution to extend organ survival time to 6-12hrs - thats huge & clinical trails also point to reduced transplant risk. See photo below of Xvivo Heart Assist Transport module transporting a deceased 48yr olds heart from French West Indies to Paris on Air France flight in Jan 2024. Donor heart was successfully transplanted to 70 yr old after 12hrs of preservation.

Opportunity ? With just ~160,000 transplants/yr growing 5-7%/yr the World Health Org says this only meets 10% of total need & with just 30% of available donor hearts used for transplants the end result is 17 people in the US die every day waiting for an organ. Best guess is with improved technology the # of transplants can rise to 1m/yr. 

My view - Xvivo has a pioneering technology that will become a new standard of care & with demand for organs 10x higher than supply the demand for machine perfusion should grow significantly. Co has a history of continuous profitable growth, reported a breakout 2Q with Revenue +35%, margins +500bp to 24%, EBITDA 2x, EPS 3x & the stock jumped 25%. These are early days for a new technology that has a huge mkt opportunity & as Xvivo wins more EU & FDA approvals I see many more blowout Q’s

[01/01/2025, 08:26:39] ~ Yakov Schleider: Comparison from perplexity AI:
[01/01/2025, 08:26:41] ~ Yakov Schleider: Certainly! Here’s the information presented in a column format for easier reading:

### Comparison of XVIVO Perfusion Solutions and TransMedics Systems

**Technology Focus:**  
- **XVIVO Perfusion:** Ex vivo machine perfusion (EVMP) for extended organ preservation and reconditioning.  
- **TransMedics (e.g., OCS):** Portable normothermic perfusion systems for real-time organ viability assessment during transport.  

**Preservation Approach:**  
- **XVIVO Perfusion:** Offers hypothermic and normothermic perfusion options (e.g., Liver Assist, Heart Box).  
- **TransMedics:** Primarily normothermic perfusion, mimicking physiological conditions.  

**Applications:**  
- **XVIVO Perfusion:** Broad range: lungs, heart, liver, kidneys; focuses on reconditioning and marginal donor organ utilization.  
- **TransMedics:** Lungs, heart, liver; emphasizes live monitoring and immediate transplantation.  

**Portability:**  
- **XVIVO Perfusion:** Limited portability for some devices (e.g., Liver Assist).  
- **TransMedics:** Fully portable systems designed for transport.  

**Clinical Benefits:**  
- **XVIVO Perfusion:** Prolonged preservation times, reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and expanded donor pool.  
- **TransMedics:** Real-time functional assessment and reduced cold ischemia time.  

**Organ Survival Times:**  
- **XVIVO Perfusion:** Up to 24 hours for livers (hypothermic), ~9 hours for hearts (HOPE).  
- **TransMedics:** Up to 24 hours for lungs (normothermic), ~12 hours for hearts.  

This format allows for a clearer comparison between XVIVO Perfusion and TransMedics systems across various features.

Below is overview of my entry Implantica

Overview
Implantica is a Medical Technology producer responsible for developing Medical Implants. The Founder and Majority shareholder is Dr Peter Forsell. (Dr. Forsell was the Executive Chairman of Obtech Medical AG ......commercialized the SAGB, an adjustable gastric band to treat obesity that Dr. Forsell developed. The gastric band peaked at 42% market share of all obesity surgery. ) He sold this to johnson and johnson for eur 175 mn (Pre FDA approval) and invested 85 into implantica.
 
The main implant is called RefluxStop, which is used to treat chronic acid reflux. Acid Reflux (formally GERD or LPR) patients typically rely on medicine called PPIs but
1) this is not a prevention measure,
2) are expensive when used for years,
3) don't work for all patients,
4) affect gut health and
5) according to some don't prevent the GERD esophageal cancer risk. 
 
Here is an explanation of PPIs and their shortcomings:
https://youtu.be/cQMWmeChSXc?si=J8rlOmoW5gvjsBCq
 
 
RefluxStop is a two-hour keyhole surgery with few if any side effects. Patients are typically home on the same day. They can exercise within a week. The following interview is an example of how it has completely changed one man's life:

Here is an explanation of RefluxStop Surgery:
https://youtu.be/5l-k9_RehB8?si=Vc2mpANHgDMTjBsY
 
Here is the surgery (not for the squeamish) but it shows how easy it is for the surgeon.

Comparison with Peers
 
The only alternate treatment today is surgery which compresses the oesophagus (Like a LINX surgery) and have multiple complications associated including patients inability to swallow, burp or vomit afterwards...or lift heavy weights. Many people are also not eligible for these surgeries.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Market Opportunity
 

Burden of gastroesophageal reflux disease in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of disease study 2019 | BMC Public Health | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)
  --about seventeen percent of the European population – over 127 million people in Europe alone – suffer from 17 GERD on a weekly basis.  
 
 
 
 
 

The bottomline here is that 10% of the population have acid reflux. We now have a cheaper and better solution reaching a critical mass in Europe. Three more countries have just begun using the treatment (Spain, Italy and Norway) AND THE NUMBER OF PROCEDURES HAS JUST CROSSED 1000.
 
Financials Overview
 
market Cap of $181 mn
Net Cash Rough $71mn giving an implied EV of $110mn.
 
The Adjusted gross margin on each surgery is 92-95% and sales are growing 50% YoY. The list price is EUR5900 per device.
 
Current cashburn is 6.5mn EUR per quarter.
 
 
 
Compelling Setup:
 
• I estimate It would take an additional 1100 purchases (surgeries) per quarter to get to breakeven cashflow. I don't think this is a big ask at all and if the company could get to a 1.5% market share of acid reflux surgeries (circa 12000 surgeries per year) we could see this on a 25% fcf yield. Imagine if we get to 5%? 
 
• Dr Forsell is a 47% shareholder. Nicole Pehrsson bought 42k shares of stock in January.
 
• FDA submission is pending, they are approaching it in a modular submission and are waiting for feedback on stage 2 of 3.
 
• CE approval in Europe already achieved and over 1000 surgeries now performed.
 
• Recently Index inclusion announcement.
 
• The main delay in the sales cycle is getting the Health Insurers to pay for the surgery which is slowly happening and NHS approval is pending. (decision expected in 2025 from NICE)
 
• Please see here for the plethora of good news on the name:
• Press Releases - Implantica
• 'Revolutionary' device to stop acid reflux given to first patients in UK (ladbible.com)
• Imperial College Healthcare first NHS Trust to offer innovative new procedure for severe acid reflux | Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust
 
• Amazing review:
• Dr. Leonardo Vincenti Opens Dedicated Clinic After he saw one of the national TV interviews, Dr. Leonardo Vincenti, Head of Surgery of the largest hospital specialized in gastroenterology in Italy, the ”De Bellis” in Castellana Grotte, and Center of excellence in Puglia region, decided to open an outpatient clinic dedicated to RefluxStop™️ patients. This was to better manage the high number of requests coming in from local patients and those from neighboring regions. ”Unlike traditional surgeries, RefluxStop™️ has no side effects such as difficulty swallowing the food bolus, gas bloating, etc.” said Dr. Vincenti.
 
• Tender awarded in March in Spain. Likely an additional 30 Surgeries this year. You only need 180 to print sequential 100% YoY growth and I believe that , given the recent media attention, we are likely only one or two quarters away from a significant upwards growth inflection.
[01/01/2025, 11:14:00] Nick finegold: I am not sure on the comps , what can say emphatically after last night is can I please have their number as I have several vital organs in need of replacement this morning .

[01/01/2025, 17:20:55] ~ Mark Astley: ☝️☝️☝️

Btw, I just spotted a (LaTeX-math) typo in the doc that I sent you this morning:

In the 2nd item on the list of seven numerological facts about 2025, the expression *(1^2+2^2+1^3+2^3)^2*, plainly does not yield 2025: it produces *196*(=14^2).

I suppose the author meant to write/type:

[(1^2+2^2) × (1^3+2^3)]^2 =

[(1+4)×(1+8)]^2 =

(5×9)^2 =

45^2 =

2025

But I suppose (s)he may have had a hangover from the *Reveillon* last night...👍👍👍
[02/01/2025, 14:13:35] ~ William Nutting: All. Happy New Year. 
In a flurry on New Years Eve Nick F was playing Noel Gallagher to my Damon Albarn by offering to buy my new album 🤣. I am very grateful. 
A number of you messaged re. Interest in The Sycamore Gap Fund and if any others please do message me as am not mentioning again. 
*Please note that the fund is exclusively for elective or professional investors. To be very clear you cannot receive anything without an arms length proccess here that sorts this with a self-cerifying link.*

For clarity, The Sycamore Gap Fund is cayman registered/ FCA regulated and run from London by  George Olver and a team at AKJ ($24bn of digital assets) that can “do” tokenisation, Digitisation of RWA’s ( real world assets) Depin, Blockchain and things like “AI Agents”. ( Nick F def rolling his eyes but he is getting it!) essentially this is stuff most of us dont want to really do ourselves!
Once qualified SG can send you a couple of great decks that outline the DEPIN thesis and provide more detail on the funds general positioning within digital assets and blockchain.

[02/01/2025, 15:29:00] ~ Ben Finegold: Long story short. Inkai is 5-6% of global primary production. As most of you know Kazatomprom have ongoing issues sourcing the acid they need to produce uranium. We have had a view that are allocating this acid to ‘friendly assets’ to the detriment of Western JVs. I think they will use this “regulatory obstacle” to mask these ongoing issues and use it as reasoning for a production guidance downgrade. I’d expect to see this sooner rather than later. Usually very positive for uranium prices.

Without them there is no SMR or reactivated Nuclear Power ; in reality the only proper new reactor fuel that exists! 
Seth Grae, CEO and Chair of the American Nuclear Society’s International Council, was responsible for developing and implementing the United Arab Emirates national nuclear energy strategy. The Barakah project's 4 full size reactors, each with a capacity of 1.5GW, are now online; all under budget and ahead of schedule. This has never been done before. He understands execution & engineering. 
There is NO sell side analyst coverage yet in the USA, the company has circa $40 mill in the bank and zero debt.

* NASDAQ listed LTBR is the world leader in new nuclear fuel development;
* Its role in the world’s existing reactors and in the transition to new reactors, big and small, will be fundamental;
* It addresses all anti-nuclear energy issues too:
    * The fuel operates at 300°C (572°F) rather than 1,300 °C (2,372°F) which addresses safety concerns;
    * It is useable in the world's 420 existing reactors as well as new small and large reactors being developed;
    * Existing reactors can have their lives extended by 40 to 80 years, as has happened in USA;
    * The fuel can produce 30% more electricity so 30% more revenue, which addresses financial concerns; 
    * The spent fuel cannot be weaponised, which deals with the proliferation issue; and it can be reprocessed, which is hugely relevant for waste management; and
* Their partners in USA are the US Government via Idaho National Labs and independent studies by MIT have confirmed performance.

[07/01/2025, 21:57:14] ~ Danny Solomon: Presumably a US invasion of Greenland would trigger NATO’s Article 5 and the US would have to fight itself.
[07/01/2025, 21:58:45] ~ Zac Bobolakis: In all seriousness, what this means is that the range of outcomes and of paths to those outcomes multiply (both in geopolitics and in global economy). Previously unimaginable scenarios become possible, even if only very very remotely. As the probabilities of these fluctuate, we are probably entering a period of persistently high volatility. Fed dot plots and forward guidance ambiguity will look like a footnote.
[07/01/2025, 22:03:07] ~ Mark Lewis: Obvious point but if Trump were to take Greenland by force, then good luck explaining to China why they can’t do the same with Taiwan.

Hearts and minds seem to be won by "mine is bigger" arguments.
[07/01/2025, 22:14:37] ~ Zac Bobolakis: The bigger issue would be: what is the future of NATO if Greenland (and Canada) is game?
[07/01/2025, 22:18:21] ~ Mark Lewis: Absolutely, point is it would herald the end of whatever residual sense of international law we still have left (it’s already hanging by a thread as it is). 

The US has already lost legitimacy in the Global South over perceived double standards, this would be the coup de grâce. 

Toto, I don’t think we are in Kansas anymore.
[07/01/2025, 22:41:25] ~ Zac Bobolakis: On Taiwan, I still believe that strategically China would rather wait and keep building military power for years to come. Even so, the probability of invasion this decade has gone up. What has definitely become a plausible scenario though is a large scale sabotage of Taiwan, which given its role in chip manufacturing, would be a major supply chain event. The worse the economy is, the more likely.

[08/01/2025, 06:23:08] ~ Stretch: I spoke to Eric Schmidt over Christmas and he said that Trump has absolutely no intention of invading Greenland. He just wants to put pressure on the Danes to start working with the US to defend Western interests .

[08/01/2025, 07:21:29] ~ Matt H: There could be a referendum in Greenland to see if it wants to stay Danish or become part of the US. Why would you swap decent health care etc for the US system?
[08/01/2025, 07:23:01] Nick finegold: Samsung +3.5% . Going forward it’s whether they can get back in the GPU game .
[08/01/2025, 07:23:04] Nick finegold: Samsung Electronics reported soft Q4 op. profit at KRW6.5B, a steep shortfall vs. the Bloomberg consensus of KRW8.96B and the Reuters/LSEG forecast of KRW7.7T. Sales missed too, coming in at KRW75T (vs. the consensus of KRW77.5T). Sentiment was fairly cautious around Samsung, so the fact numbers came in light won’t be a huge shock, but this is a pretty big downside release. Part of Samsung’s problem is company-specific, as the firm has been late to the HBM chip market (which is been a boon for SK Hynix and Micron given massive AI-linked demand), but the broader tech demand environment outside of AI data centers isn’t exactly booming (recall Micron back on 12/18 warned of a pronounced inventory correction in non-AI end markets, with weakness in PCs, autos, and industrial). While Samsung’s Q4 numbers are ugly, the firm likely won’t be a non-factor in HBM for long (Jensen on Tues expressed optimism that Samsung will eventually become a major HBM player), and the company has a smartphone launch event coming up on Jan 22. Keep in mind that Samsung shares have been poor performers compared to other large-cap tech peers, and trade at a PE of only ~10-11x.
[08/01/2025, 07:31:26] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Keep in mind that Samsung Electronics has other lower growth/margin revenue sources so not pure play. But yes, cheap.
[08/01/2025, 07:34:31] ~ David Haysey: Possibly because with 60k citizens you could offer the choice of a welcome bonus of $1m per head if they vote to join! This would make the Alaska purchase look cheap.

[08/01/2025, 10:18:18] ~ Philip Donald: Meta’s Llama 3.1 last summer was trained for 8 weeks on half a billion dollars of Nvidia GPUs. But over the holidays Deepseek, a Chinese hedge fund that has been building its own models, woke everyone up. It released Deepseek 3, which it claims has comparable benchmark scores to GPT4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 and to have achieved this with perhaps 10% of the training compute of Llama 3.1 (yes - I am simplifying this a great deal). 

There is plenty of skepticism about this, on a number of technical fronts, but it points to how open the field remains: there are no moats, the science is very fluid, we don’t have a solid sense of the theoretical limits we’re working within, and the economics could change, a lot.      https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf

Shares in the Milan-based company have risen threefold in the past four years, taking its market value to €18bn, amid surging demand for high voltage connectors that link offshore wind farms to electricity grids, as countries race to decarbonise their electricity systems.

Prysmian already generates about 35 per cent of its revenue in the US and is looking for components manufacturers in the telecommunications sector to strengthen its digital offer in data centres.

It’s something I had been thinking about before he started this crusade . Boycotting Tesla . Why wouldn’t you there is tons of good alternatives now and the brands stale. ‎<This message was edited>
[09/01/2025, 08:29:53] ~ Matt H: I wonder how many Teslas are sold in Blue states vs Red states? I suspect California might be one of the largest markets for Tesla. Chinese sales will go as well. Is Tesla a short ? Would be a brave bet.

[09/01/2025, 08:55:29] ~ gerhard: i think there is a clear political bias towards tesla buyer in zhe US and Europe. there are much more alternatve products now in the market than a few years ago… und think his car sales will drop again in 2025. the youngest tsla model is allread 4 years old … inovation zero. best example for key person risk 
with the valuation of tesla its a clear short …. , but u need guts … good luck ‎<This message was edited>

[09/01/2025, 09:07:53] ~ JB: And miles cheaper!
[09/01/2025, 18:05:44] ~ Stretch: I disagree. The Tesla manufacturing process is insanely profitable. It takes just 90 components to make a car. Elon is way ahead on the data acquisition from the Cars which is gonna mean that he’s gonna be first into autonomy. Which is gonna take him into the delivery van market . Tesla  Currently has 12,000 employees which is going to go to 5000 employees with the same output. And he is a president who feels entirely grateful for getting him elected.  Personally, I’m buying more stock happy to be judged in December.
[09/01/2025, 18:06:06] ~ Stretch: Has
[09/01/2025, 18:06:19] ~ William Nutting: Im with you 100%
[09/01/2025, 18:07:07] ~ Stretch: Another interesting fact is that this continuous improvement iterative process means that three different plants producing teslas can produce three different innovative cars. This decentralised innovation means that they’re constantly upgrading innovating and getting better.
[09/01/2025, 18:08:16] ~ Stretch: Expect a 60 component Tesla car in the next 12 months
[09/01/2025, 18:14:38] ~ JB: What does the AV needed for all cities to reduce congestion look like?
[09/01/2025, 18:17:02] ~ Pearsy: Imho Tesla isn’t a car company it’s a tech company and it’s now at the heart of and pulling the strings of the biggest global economy. Its robots will become the police, army and bedrock of everything land, sea ,and space based. As more dollars get printed, and more dollars make their way back onshore why would you short it. Or any U.S. blue chip.
[09/01/2025, 18:18:03] Nick finegold: No doubt he is the lowest cost producer and the most brilliant manufacture . I guess a boycott is more
Emotionally based and less financially based as a decision . But it’s a super interesting debate . It would be super interesting I do a pole if US consumers to see if they even care about his political interventions .
[09/01/2025, 18:26:00] ~ David Haysey: The bull case for Tesla behind the seeming super premium valuation was always around the IP (patents and data) and what that meant for autonomous driving and the idea of cars to rent (dial one when you need one as being the possible future-why own an asset that sits idle 98% of the time) which is the big prize. Me I’d rather take the bus than give the fascist adjacent  man-child a cent.
[09/01/2025, 18:29:33] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Most bull (efficiency/innovation/cult) and bear (valuation/competition/cult/boycott risk/OEM a terrible business) are sensible and relevant but not the most relevant. For several years now TSLA is EM's investment vehicle - mkt gives him capital to invest as he likes. This has happened with others before, it does not guarantee success but clearly his association with DJT have increased his chances of success materially. Since this concept reached escape velocity (excuse the pun) a few years ago, TSLA has become a speculative long and a reckless short.
[09/01/2025, 18:46:08] ~ Zac Bobolakis: AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, META have the same characteristic except they already have a very solid profitable business (and expensive but not outrageous valuation) and in most cases no personality cult. NVDA has the cult but JH has so far stuck to a single product. But it's not far. They may go down. But you can't short them now.
[09/01/2025, 18:47:17] ~ William Nutting: Also remember these 8 co’s are actually >700 acquisitions of incredible businesses….
[09/01/2025, 18:49:59] ~ Zac Bobolakis: They also acquire garbage that burns money gets forgotten. But whatever you think of eg GOOG's core business, why would you short the embedded options of Deep mind, Quantum Computing etc
[09/01/2025, 18:50:07] ~ Stretch: Chinese EV car  consolidation about to happen as well further enhancing Elon’s position
[09/01/2025, 18:52:46] ~ Pearsy: Elon is also agitating and destabilising most of Europe at a time where those countries are crying out for strong leadership and open to change
[09/01/2025, 18:54:24] ~ Stretch: Also all of Waymos car partnerships have underwhelmed
[09/01/2025, 18:56:17] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Maybe maybe not. Marginal in my view. Car stocks are trading stocks, not investments. They consolidate to stay in business, not to win. But TSLA not a car stock. It's an investment vehicle.
[09/01/2025, 18:58:30] ~ Zac Bobolakis: How can you tell? Simple. If EM walked out or something happened to him, TSLA would fall by 90%.
[09/01/2025, 18:59:23] ~ Stretch: Like Apple after jobs
[09/01/2025, 18:59:32] ~ GR: That scenario is not baked in to the share price, because I guess it's a very low probability
[09/01/2025, 19:02:50] ~ Zac Bobolakis: More like Apple without Jobs in the 90s. When SJ died, Apple already had a solid business. TSLA minus EM would become a car company and def not worth1trn.
[09/01/2025, 19:03:52] ~ Stretch: We’re having read the biography.I’m pretty sure he doesn’t have a succession plan.
[09/01/2025, 19:04:11] ~ Stretch: Well not we’re sorry
[09/01/2025, 19:07:51] ~ Stretch: I’m still long. If you take the technology into delivery, defence, logistics and you accept that he is beautifully positioned politically, and that Waymo doesn’t even have a car  , and that he has a system of constant iteration and improvement which came from the tech industry and that the car industry does not understand , I’m still a buyer
[09/01/2025, 19:09:33] ~ Stretch: The mistake that most people make about Tesla is that they think it’s all about the product and it’s actually not only about the Product. The advantage comes from the process, constant micro innovation reducing costs and improving the product providing continuous margin expansion
[09/01/2025, 19:10:32] ~ Stretch: If somebody comes along with a 30 component car and a better process, I’ll start getting worried

[12/01/2025, 14:28:50] Nick finegold: Not sure that’s why you buy it , but quite a few of their portfolio companies are close to profitable
[12/01/2025, 14:30:13] ~ Neil G: Of course it isn’t, but sadly it’s what most IT investors want! Even if it comes at the cost of Total Returns in my view!

[15/01/2025, 23:32:46] Nick finegold: Hindenberg research disbands . I wonder what will happen to Fuzzy Panda ? 

This is a great read from the founder .
[15/01/2025, 23:33:00] Nick finegold: A Personal Note From Our Founder
As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.

I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.

I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.

When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.

It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.

And then this slowly started to flourish.

One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.

They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.

We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.

Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.

And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.

Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.

It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.

I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.

So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.

Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.

Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.

My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.

For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.

It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.

To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.

Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.

With unfathomable levels of gratitude,

Nate Anderson

[16/01/2025, 05:50:24] Nick finegold: Yes , they were top quality compared to Kung Fu Panda , I think it’s actually going to have quite an impact on quite a few stocks
[16/01/2025, 05:52:52] ~ William Nutting: To name a few….

Adani Group
Hindenburg’s most impactful report targeted the Adani Group in January 2023. The allegations of fraud and stock manipulation led to a staggering $150 billion rout in Adani Group stocks. This report shook the Indian conglomerate to its core and sparked widespread debate about corporate governance in India.
Nikola Corporation
In September 2020, Hindenburg published a scathing report on Nikola, an electric vehicle startup. The investigation revealed deceptive practices, including a staged video of a semi-truck rolling downhill to appear self-powered. This report led to significant consequences:
	•	The resignation of Nikola’s founder, Trevor Milton
	•	Criminal indictment of Milton for securities fraud
	•	Milton’s conviction on three counts of fraud and a four-year prison sentence
Icahn Enterprises
In 2023, Hindenburg targeted Carl Icahn’s publicly traded vehicle, Icahn Enterprises. The report accused the company of luring retail investors with unsustainable distributions while concealing the risks associated with Icahn’s personal margin loans.
Block Inc.
Hindenburg also targeted Block Inc., the financial technology company led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.
Opko Health
In 2017, Hindenburg published a report on Opko Health, uncovering connections to criminal activities and product failures. This led to SEC charges against the company’s CEO and the company itself for fraud in 2018.
Ebix, Inc.
Hindenburg scrutinized Ebix, a fintech company, in 2022-2023. The report warned of inflated revenue numbers and massive debt load. By December 2023, Ebix filed for bankruptcy, confirming Hindenburg’s warnings about its financial instability.
Carvana
In its final report on January 2, 2025, Hindenburg accused auto retailer Carvana of accounting irregularities, calling it a “father-son accounting grift for the ages”.
These cases demonstrate Hindenburg Research’s significant impact on the financial markets, often leading to regulatory investigations, criminal charges, and substantial market value losses for the targeted companies.

[16/01/2025, 05:55:17] ~ Ben Finegold: Most of these guys go after pre-revenue / high multiple businesses with little resources to fight legal battles.
[16/01/2025, 05:59:19] Nick finegold: Quite possibly the start of a slow forming but long term trend in allocation to BTC . 

What fascinates me about this is that even if you are a huge sceptic and hate crypto , you still
probably have to buy some,  just in case  .

[16/01/2025, 16:26:26] ~ JB: UNH down -5% on a 1% rev miss for Q4 is a massive over reaction. 

The Conf call transcript is worth reading for a proper insight into the US healthcare system. 

UNH is at the forefront at automation, reducing system costs and providing value based care.   UNH’s PBM Optum RX will move from 98% to 100% pass through of negotiated savings on drugs prices.  GLP1 in the US will cost $900 vs $90 in Europe. 

Customer satisfaction and engagement is at record levels.  In 2024 the number of customers returning to UNH from peers was up 3x.

2025 has had a good start and UNH is bullish on customer mix. 

UNH is now cheap growth and still a name you can put $10bn into.

[19/01/2025, 20:44:14] ~ William Nutting: Extraordinary and exciting times, whilst stock markets are closed right now most cant do much for 2 days. What $TRUMP showed in the last 48hrs; from 0.18c to $70 now is the speed velocity and simplicity of capital formation in the web 3.0 digital world. 
Meme coins and ICO's before them were the test case but the real game is yet to come and it will completely revolutionise capital markets.
Simply put, we have now officially left the “dot-crypto” phase of blockchain. All of the existing use cases of crypto are from crypto-native companies, but going forward, the whole world will now come up with creative ways to use tokens. ( RWA Tokenisation of cash-flows to create a Meta-coin). IMO, also the biggest upside comes from non-crypto native co's entering this space. KKR, Apollo, Nike, Starbucks, Reddit, Trump, etc bring way more users & wallets than slow crypto-native organic growth.

The swings in ethereum and solana . They are wild , I went to pick up a pizza and I was £30k up on IG came back and I am flat ! Most expensive pepperoni I have ever had. .

Interestingly BTC holds relatively firm .

[20/01/2025, 00:56:42] Nick finegold: I asked chat GPT 

What on earth is happening with crypto markets today ?
[20/01/2025, 00:57:26] Nick finegold: The response was as follows .

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility today, influenced by several key developments:

1. Launch of $TRUMP Meme Coin
	•	President-elect Donald Trump introduced the $TRUMP meme coin, which rapidly surged in value, reaching a market capitalization of approximately $13.5 billion.  ￼
	•	The coin’s price exhibited extreme fluctuations, peaking at over $75 before stabilizing around $49.  ￼
	•	This launch has attracted both enthusiasm and criticism, with concerns about market manipulation and investor risk.  ￼

2. Market Impact and Volatility
	•	The introduction of the $TRUMP coin has diverted significant trading volumes, affecting liquidity in other cryptocurrencies and contributing to market instability.  ￼
	•	Major cryptocurrencies have experienced notable price movements:
	•	Bitcoin (BTC): Currently trading at $99,993, down 4.06% from the previous close, with an intraday high of $106,307 and a low of $99,539.
	•	Ethereum (ETH): Priced at $3,168.80, a 4.43% decrease, with an intraday high of $3,441.53 and a low of $3,130.11.
	•	BNB (BNB): At $676.51, down 5.03%, with an intraday high of $715.45 and a low of $671.80.
	•	XRP (XRP): Trading at $2.96, a decline of 8.92%, with an intraday high of $3.28 and a low of $2.90.
	•	Cardano (ADA): Priced at $0.97381, down 13.82%, with an intraday high of $1.15 and a low of $0.968586.

3. Regulatory Developments
	•	President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance includes plans to sign executive orders related to Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry, potentially influencing market dynamics.  ￼

4. Industry Movements
	•	Mark Karpelès, former head of the Mt. Gox exchange, is attempting a comeback with a new venture, EllipX, focusing on security and transparency in cryptocurrency exchanges.  ￼

Investors should exercise caution during these turbulent times, as the market reacts to new developments and potential regulatory changes.
[20/01/2025, 02:59:48] Nick finegold: I am now in Barbados and 4 hours behind most of you having just watched the Bills beat the Ravens . 

Today’s shenanigans with the President issuing a Trump coin is a good example of the sort of volatility that is going to become routine. 

My gut reaction is that Trump is above all else a greedy capitalist . The worry with this type of behaviour historically has been market manipulation, but when you get to appoint the head of the SEC and have just been found guilty of a felony and served no time and won the White House simultaneously I doubt you are too worried about being prosecuted . 

My point being that this is probably more wildly bullish for BTC and the leading crypto names than even the most crazy bulls ever would have imagined .

The sell off was just people switching from one to the other and quite temporary . 

God only knows what happens next but I feel it in my bones that BTC could double again now in quite short order . 

We shall see .
[20/01/2025, 05:30:05] ~ William Nutting: “Folks, I launched the most beautiful Trump coin yesterday, absolutely beautiful. Everyone was saying "Sir, this is the greatest coin launch in history."
But then Melania - and listen, I love Melania, fantastic woman, used to be my favorite wife - she comes out with her own coin. Can you believe it? Very nasty move, very nasty. My coin was doing great numbers, the best numbers, and then BOOM - down it goes. People are saying it's the biggest betrayal since what Crazy Nancy did to Sleepy Joe. That was terrible, wasn't it? The Dems, I tell you folks, are just terrible people. Look what they have done to our country. This used to be a great country. 
And you know what? I had a great call with my good friend Elon - brilliant guy, loves rockets, almost as smart as me - and he's got this fantastic rocket going to Mars.
Beautiful rocket, beautiful planet, red like my tie. And I said, "Elon, buddy, do you have room for one more passenger? I've got this problem here on Earth with my coin. I say we send Melania to Mars. She told me she always wanted to be a star." 
And once she's gone - and this is the beautiful part - we're going to make cryptocurrency great again. No more spouse coins. Just pure, beautiful Trump coins. And believe me, the next wife - and there will be a next wife, maybe the best wife ever - she's going to sign a pre-launch agreement. Very strict, very legal, no other coins allowed!”

[22/01/2025, 08:24:01] ~ Richard Windsor: Indeed...Google has put an end to a whole branch of scientific discovery known as x-ray crystallography... which was previously protein structure was worked out. it was hugely expensive and time consuming.

The other point is that they will be able to slash their headcount at some stage due to ai. 

I think they are unlikely to own a car company directly because they want to be a pasty of the operating system inside of all cars ?

[22/01/2025, 19:10:30] ~ Craig Fenton: As an ex Googler, always happy to kick this around.  They are at the cusp of opportunity and threat.  Threat: while their AI (Gemini) is good they lost the race to GPT, and need to allocate billions to the compute power of multi modal Gen AI, which will eventually render it's cash cow obsolete, and do this before they figure out the business model.  The opportunity - figuring it out and carrying the momentum forward into a base of 9 products with more than 1bn users. Also - finding new business.  In cars they aspire to become the operating system with Waymo.  The hardware is not interesting. Biotech - perhaps though it's a very different business.  More likely a licence model arming big pharma.  Interesting and high scale.  Demis likely the next CEO.
[22/01/2025, 19:19:37] Nick finegold: Thanks Craig that’s deeply appreciated . So here’s a question , what are you doing with the  shares that you got given  as COO of alphabet EMEA , keeping them or selling them ?

2/ insurance companies can hold BTC on the asset side of their balance sheet .

Pretty unique business and a gold mine of data for VC shops etc. anyway, I tested them out on some other small direct / privates where one of my guys is invested to check whether the spiel on how amazing and unique and game changing the patents that these private companies said they had… which is ultimately a key part of why folks invest in them. When you crunch thru all the data, you realise that in most fields imaginable (and I mean everything from insect protein to some mad life sciences stuff)… there is always someone else who has a near identical patent. and that someone else… is ALWAYS Google

Unlike their earthbound counterparts, space-based solar panels can harvest sunlight continuously, unaffected by seasons, weather or the day/night cycle. Given there is no atmosphere between them and the sun, they are also thought to be around 10 times more efficient at energy collection. The plan is for the array to transmit energy back to the planet’s surface using microwaves, in theory producing as much energy in a year as the “total quantity of oil that can be extracted from the Earth”.

“Our security pipeline includes a wide range of opportunities, both internationally and domestically. Moreover, domestic growth would accelerate driven by the new administration's national security policies. With both major political parties supporting enhanced border security, we are well positioned to play a key role. Our nonintrusive inspection technologies are ideally suited to bolster security at airports, ports, borders and other critical infrastructure points. Overall, while product revenue growth has been robust, we expect service revenue as a percentage of overall security revenues to increase and these historically have a higher margin.” 

I can’t see this stock having a bad year , it remains in our buy list for 2025 .
[24/01/2025, 09:34:23] Adam Clib: Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, addressed the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, forecasted that Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially reach a value of USD 700,000. Historically, such ambitious price forecasts for BTC have been primarily discussed among dedicated cryptocurrency supporters and enthusiasts.
Fink reiterated his earlier statements, emphasizing that for those concerned about currency devaluation or the economic and political stability of their nations, Bitcoin serves as a globally recognized asset. He stated that BTC has the potential to alleviate these local anxieties. Furthermore, Fink mentioned his involvement with a sovereign wealth fund that was deliberating on whether to invest 2% or 5% of its portfolio in Bitcoin. He concluded by suggesting that if this dialogue were to gain traction, Bitcoin prices could soar to between 500,000 and 700,000.

[24/01/2025, 10:43:05] Nick finegold: Just had a chat with Ali . A couple of simple things to come out of our conversation that are quite seismic if true .

Deepseek claims to have produced this LLM at a tiny fraction of the cost . 90% less maybe more and it’s brilliant. 

And it’s uses a fraction of the number of GPU’s . 10,00”

If you download it , it’s not impossible the Chinese Government will know everything about you and your business .

Remember that alphabet / Google is banned from China . I suspect this will get banned from the west but it will probably be too late .
[24/01/2025, 10:44:31] Nick finegold: Implications here everywhere . Nvidia , Meta . Both on the cost side , ie they might not need the billions of $ of GPU’s they think and on the threat side to their ai supremacy .

‎[24/01/2025, 11:29:07] ~ A: ‎image omitted
[24/01/2025, 11:32:43] ~ Richard Windsor: The problem is that all of the Deepseek data except the independently run tests are deeply suspect. This is because DeepSeek is clearly working with the Chinese state which is engaged in a propaganda campaign to entive the media into believing that its technology is better than it really is. The spin around Huawei's 7nm chip is more than evidence enough of this.  Consequently, I am taking everything with a bucket of salt and am not inclined to believe anything I read when it comes to the economics of training.
[24/01/2025, 11:33:23] Nick finegold: About time you showed up in this convo
[24/01/2025, 11:34:06] ~ A: The most interesting aspect is technical … they’ve trained their model using a very different technique (RL) on a large reasoning dataset… the very surprising thing is how good this model has then become at reasoning outside of the data it’s been trained on
[24/01/2025, 11:35:01] ~ Richard Windsor: Consequently, No one knows how much DeepSeek spent to train that model. If it was given free electricity by the CCP and plenty of time it could have trained it on the A100 rack that we know that it has. I would not trust anything at all. The only conclusion that it is safe to draw is that China has come up with a model that performs really well and this is an impressive feat. It shows what we have always known and written many times which is that China is a leader in AI but whether it can do any of this economically or at scale is a total unknown. Only time will tell.
[24/01/2025, 11:38:19] ~ Richard Windsor: Again here I have issues. None of these models can reason. They can simulate reasoning by solving problems using the same or similar methods available in their data set but they always fail the most basic reasoning tasks such as if a=b then it follows that b=a. In my opinion, there is no reasoning, only pattern matching. If R1 was trained on a reasoning dataset then it follows that it will do well on the standardised tests as this is what it has been trained for., Openai cheats in exactly the same way. Thes models can all run but the cannot walk meaning that they are so flawed as to be untrustworthy and unreliable.
[24/01/2025, 11:40:02] ~ A: No, I think they’ve made a breakthrough of sorts in reasoning using a different form of reinforcement learning. 
I understand how they can cheat but this looks different. 
I’m pretty sure that all LLMs will incorporate this technique in their next releases.
[24/01/2025, 11:42:07] ~ Richard Windsor: if you are right then we are closer to AGI... However, there is no empirical evidence that proves reasoning from first principles and until I see some, I continue to think that there is a lot of smoke and mirrors going on here.
[24/01/2025, 11:43:30] ~ A: Even from basic empirical use, I can tell a difference between ChatGPT PRO “think” and DeepSeek “Deep Think”… 

But yes that’s not enough of a benchmark
[24/01/2025, 11:44:24] ~ Richard Windsor: don't disagree there is a difference...I would argue that the simulation has become more sophisticated.
[24/01/2025, 11:44:26] ~ A: ChatGPT uses chain of thought and DeepSeek uses RL reward system…
[24/01/2025, 11:47:59] ~ A: Interesting to me that both in biotech and AI, china has exploded on the scene in the last year
[24/01/2025, 11:48:49] ~ A: Big pharma buying ready made molecules almost all from Chinese labs… 
I don’t think this and AI is a coincidence, it’s a strategy by china
[24/01/2025, 11:49:35] ~ A: Tech and biotech basically being arguably the most important sectors
[24/01/2025, 11:50:31] ~ A: And then there’s the UK… happily let’s biotechs delist from the exchange, like mine!! 
It’s not rocket science!
[24/01/2025, 11:54:25] ~ Richard Windsor: Exactly,...its a CCP priority which is why the data is so suspect
[24/01/2025, 11:55:09] ~ A: Well the other way to look at it, if they think they’re in a war (which they are), all rules are out of the window
[24/01/2025, 11:55:26] ~ A: The uk needs to go on a war footing
[24/01/2025, 11:55:34] ~ Richard Windsor: 100% agree... one of my research vertcials covers this war.

[26/01/2025, 02:34:19] Nick finegold: I really believe that being short Gold and long BTC needs some real thought. It makes sense to find the money for the BTC reserve from the gold reserve. 

“Any country with gold reserves should be holding at least 11% of that amount in bitcoin reserves," Armstrong posted to X in response to criticism of Trump's plan for a national bitcoin reserve. "And I believe in the next five to 10 years bitcoin's market cap will likely surpass gold. So these reserves should grow to exceed gold."

This week, Trump has followed through on his campaign promises to make overhauling crypto policy one of his administration's priorities, ordering the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing new regulations and exploring the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile.”
[26/01/2025, 02:36:37] Nick finegold: The above quote is from the head of coinbase who I think would be quite close to the situation . Gold stocks are cheap but I think gold the commodity might be a great short here even if it’s only temporary.

[26/01/2025, 07:18:04] ~ David Haysey: Tactically you may be right. But remember that a lot of foreign CBs like gold precisely because it’s not controlled by the US and will buy the dip.
I also don’t see why the US would in effect talk up an asset that has already shot up before they’ve built up said reserve. Unless it’s just a big grift for those who are already in.
[26/01/2025, 07:42:43] Nick finegold: I obviously agree with that David . However , they have quite a lot of BTC that has been acquired through seizures . 200,000 is thought to be a conservative estimate.

I think they use the WGC playbook , making it legal tender in some sort of way   so it can be lent , borrowed , and held in the balance sheets of insurance companies and treasury of corporates etc . This is already happening on coinbase , but they want broader based adoption . I came up with the idea of BTC being CGT free in the US which is a crazy idea , but I was just trying to think what they could do that was bonkers  ! . I would think as long as Trump was long in his personal account he won’t care too much what price the US pays, this is how he becomes Putin Rich . 

Not really sure how they get as
Long as they want but if you believe Saylor he thinks it’s going to $13m so what’s a few $100k. 

The exercise maybe about getting millions of American supporters rich and locking down their votes for years? 

As you know I am a fan of Gold . The news from China about insurance company adoption of gold  has not materialised yet . 

I just have a hunch that in the short term gold looks quite overbought on Trump type uncertainty and might pull back a tad . ‎<This message was edited>
[26/01/2025, 07:48:57] Nick finegold: It’s quite a natural place for the funds to come from if you are a crypto warrior . 

They have oil reserves , which they trade , uranium Reseves etc 

 , it may just not be possible to be as long as they want going in . But they could manipulate the market now and forever . Knowing when to buy and sell as the biggest whale of all ?  Just like the Bank of England buys and sells sterling or the fed $’s .
[26/01/2025, 09:27:37] ~ Simon Brewer: Short term gold long positioning is a reason to expect a pull back. 
Open interest in gold futures is at a 2 year high and total speculator net long is close to 3 year high. 
It looks like long bond yields may reverse down for a while which would be helpful for gold but technically I’d favour a pull back.
[26/01/2025, 09:37:32] ~ Simon Brewer: And going through the charts it looks as if the dollar has topped out.  A bear market in the dollar would surprise most folks - but it is significantly overvalued especially against Can$/NKR ( cheapest and best supported ccy in the world)Yen and AUD

[26/01/2025, 09:58:18] ~ Matt H: Gold has an RSI of 69 on a 1 year basis. Sure it could drift a bit. If the US were to sell gold reserves and buy BTC then gold could quickly fall but as SB says other CB’S would quickly pick it up and would be right to do so. 
I like many other Europeans am old world, so is Russia, India and China. Gold is real. Crypto isn’t. The tech fuelled greed driving up the US markets with AI and Crypto might be leaving the old world behind and I am getting sick of it. Maybe it is unstoppable but do we all really want to live in a brave new world. Being driven around in robo taxis (which lock the doors and drive you to where you are supposed to be rather than where you want to be), chips in our brains and fed some tasteless crap that contains all the nutrients we are supposed to have. Interacting with robots. I could go on but I think there will be others that push back on it. To me this isn’t freedom. I have gold coins stashed.
[26/01/2025, 09:59:37] ~ Danny Solomon: Regarding gold, it is the start of the Chinese New Year this week which may mean fewer buyers which supports the short term overbought look about gold. ‎<This message was edited>

Gold247 is specifically designed to create a fungible digital 21st century version, is it not ?
[26/01/2025, 10:27:01] ~ Simon Brewer: I think the answer is that just as I have owned Gold for over 25 years, there are times to trim a little and also to add, notwithstanding taxes, if your position is large enough.  I have sat on enough asset allocation committees to know it often isn’t.  In short every secular bull market has its cyclical setbacks and sometimes they can be long lasting or shorter and more violent. My bet is that money creation by CBs remains the silent assassin of our purchasing power and Gold is an important if not exclusive bulwark against this.

Gold vs. Bitcoin Debate

1 Big Thing: Gold reserves vs. Bitcoin reserves
	•	A growing conversation is emerging around the idea of nations reallocating gold reserves to Bitcoin.
	•	Brian Armstrong suggested that countries should hold at least 11% of their gold reserves in Bitcoin, predicting that Bitcoin’s market cap could surpass gold within the next 5–10 years.

Why it matters:
	•	Trump has ordered the creation of a cryptocurrency working group, signaling a push for a national cryptocurrency reserve.
	•	With the U.S. already holding 200,000 BTC from seizures, some believe this could evolve into a strategic asset for the country.

The critics:
	•	Skeptics question the strategy, noting that foreign central banks prefer gold as it’s not U.S.-controlled.
	•	Concerns have been raised about the U.S. “talking up” Bitcoin prices before building its reserves, possibly benefiting insiders.

Zoom in: Gold’s short-term outlook
	•	Gold positioning:
	•	Futures open interest is at a 2-year high, while speculator net longs are nearing 3-year highs.
	•	Gold’s RSI stands at 69, signaling it may be overbought.
	•	Seasonal factors: The start of the Chinese New Year may temporarily reduce gold buying demand.
	•	Bearish signals:
	•	A short-term pullback in gold prices is likely, with long bond yields potentially reversing downward.
	•	If the U.S. were to sell gold reserves to buy Bitcoin, prices could drop, but foreign central banks (CBs) would likely buy the dip.

Tactical takes on Bitcoin adoption
	•	Some believe a Bitcoin-as-legal-tender strategy could unlock broader adoption:
	•	Allowing BTC to be lent, borrowed, and held on corporate balance sheets (à la gold’s integration).
	•	Ideas like BTC becoming CGT-free have been floated to encourage this transition.

But there’s skepticism:
	•	Could this push simply be a way to enrich existing Bitcoin holders, including Trump himself?
	•	Michael Saylor predicts Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin, but some view the current hype as part of a political play.

A shifting dollar and gold’s old-world allure
	•	Currency moves:
	•	The dollar appears to have topped out and could enter a bear market.
	•	Undervalued currencies like CAD, NOK, JPY, and AUD are catching attention.
	•	The gold vs. crypto debate:
	•	Gold remains a favorite for many in Europe, India, and China, prized for its tangible value over “tech-fueled greed.”
	•	Yet, digital assets are pulling focus away from traditional markets.

What’s next?
	•	Gold247: A Gold Council initiative aims to digitize and modernize gold as a fungible 21st-century asset.
	•	For long-term investors, gold remains a hedge against monetary inflation and central bank-driven erosion of purchasing power.
	•	However, Bitcoin’s increasing adoption could signal a paradigm shift for reserves worldwide.

Worth noting:
	•	Classic cars, wine, and gold coins remain alternatives to Bitcoin, with gold still CGT-free in the U.K., unlike crypto.
	•	For those diversifying: Consider balance—gold for stability and Bitcoin for growth.

Stay tuned as these markets evolve, and the lines between traditional and digital assets blur.

So maybe everybody (in the West at least) has been looking at AI wrong — the race is not between the US and China, but between Chinese AI researchers based in the US and Chinese AI workers based in China:

On NVIDIA etc..
Wedbush interesting: 
“No US Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases. At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia. Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing.....launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.”

[27/01/2025, 17:35:58] Nick finegold: If you use Bill Gates equation  on climate change it’s quite helpful vs Deepseek. 

PxSxExC=0


P= Population 
S= Services required by the population 
E-= Energy required by the services 
C= Carbon .  
You quickly realise , the Population is not going to zero 

Services required by the population only grows , and is not going zero 

E Energy required by the services is the first time there is good news. This number can and always has the potential to be
Meaningfully reduced.  What deepseek did from an energy perspective is not so different to what an energy saving light bulb does x 1bn homes x 50 bulbs in each home. People are working on ways to save energy in millions of different ways 

The only letter in his equation though that can get you to zero is Carbon.  Ie we still need to decarbonise the planet as California burns and millions die each year through particulate matter in cities z 

Hence nuclear ain’t going away , it’s just going to be an even bigger part of the energy mix than we thought that’s all and we will always live in a madly energy hungry world . 

Wait til we
Plug in 1bn robots and cars , start to desalinate water at scale . 

From a global energy standpoint not a lot has changed.

From what happens to the hypersacalers they will just save a ton more money and staff.

[27/01/2025, 18:21:24] ~ Mark Lewis: I don’t even bother saying that about large-scale nukes any more because outside China nobody has ever done it.
[27/01/2025, 18:23:37] ~ Mark Lewis: Hinkley Point C is currently 5 years late and £8bn over budget
[27/01/2025, 18:24:07] ~ Matt H: Can’t help agreeing. Sizewell and Hinkley will generate the most expensive power known. They are a complete waste of money especially when we have gas as a back up. The real cost of nuclear power with all its clean up cost is not viable. It was fine when we dumped the waste in the sea but we obviously can’t do that any more.
[27/01/2025, 18:24:27] ~ Mark Lewis: And Sizewell C is now estimated to cost £40bm versus £22bn originally and the first concrete has not even been poured yet

However, by April 9, 2020, Power Technology reported that the project cost was $32 billion.[14] Startup of Unit 1 was delayed to late 2018.[15] The project was then further delayed, with commercial operation of the first reactor only achieved in April 2021.[1

[27/01/2025, 18:52:40] ~ Matt H: I hope they do get built.
[27/01/2025, 18:53:28] ~ Mark Lewis: Not just UK. France — the épicentre of the belief in nuclear fairytales — even worse at building new nukes (Flamanville has been a catastrophe on every yardstick), Finland same thing. 

When was the last time anybody in the western world built a nuclear power plant on time and on budget?

[27/01/2025, 18:55:52] ~ Mark Lewis: Also, as I have said many times on here: you cannot I sure nuclear power without the government being the backstop either directly or indirectly. No insurer will take nuclear risk without a government guarantee. 

So the cost of new nuclear is a lot higher than even the published figures tell you because without the government backstop you just wouldn’t be able to build it.

Even if I have some how do I stop it being taken from me with no recourse ?….How do others do it without fear ?….                    Cryptocurrencies are effectively bearer instruments, which means if you get hacked there’s no recourse, but a strong part of crypto ideology is that you control your own money. So, Ledger makes a hardware ‘wallet’ device to store your tokens in a secure, uncrackable offline format, with strong encryption, passwords, etc etc...

However, this week a criminal gang kidnapped the co-founder of Ledger itself, with his wife, and cut off his finger in an attempt to extract a ransom, before the French police rescued him. There’s long been a saying in cryptocurrency security circles that no amount of clever software is proof against someone hitting you with a wrench until you give them the password, but this made that very real.

I got told off for bashing Musk last time I did it but at what point do we admit that the supposed saviour of the world at best has Nazi sympathies and at worst is an actual Nazi? Coming so soon after his Nazi salute on Inauguration Day last week as well.

[28/01/2025, 08:06:22] ~ A: These comments have convinced me that Nvidia might be a buy
[28/01/2025, 08:54:04] ~ Dipesh Patel: For Jensen H the issue is at some point this was always going to be the playbook. The issue is the extent to which Nvidia has benefitted from megacap CEOs demanding their tech teams to be first in the race and 'you have any budget' together with Nvidia salesforce saying you need this and this is the price, take it or leave it. It's been a one way seller's mkt with that backdrop. That was always going to taper off. The position for Nvidia is whether their fwd products, GPUs in robots etc can replace/grow the product base beyond the expected hiatus.
[28/01/2025, 09:04:45] ~ Dipesh Patel: From what I've been reading, I think this makes sense (well beyond my limited understanding of the space). Perhaps 10-20% of the capex budgets are about the learning piece? The DS efficiency is definitely an issue for energy I suspect and the extent to which it shifts the demand curve, but that might not slow down megacaps hungry to secure base load unless they really all of a sudden feel they don't need it. We'll still likely be 16bn people at some point in coming decades and I can't see an immediate solution though.

RAOULP: “The cheaper, more efficient LLM's become in terms of compute (and they will keep getting cheaper and more efficient), the more demand for compute goes truly exponential as ASI becomes the key focus and energy needs become a lesser constraint than expected per unit of compute.”

ON DIGITAL ASSETS: No matter what is a good reminder that everything other than Bitcoin can be disrupted. Digital scarcity cannot be rediscovered… 
Also George at SYCAMORE GAP reminded me, ask yourself: What's the problem with crypto? Humans don't know how to use it.
Why don't humans know how to use it?
Well, it is built for computers to talk to computers, the very essence of composability. What's the problem with AI?
Well, Agents don't know how to use the Internet. Why don't agents know how to use the Internet? Because it’s built for humans to use.

[28/01/2025, 23:45:00] ~ JB: Ben is very good but not a tech analyst. 

AI inference is
 very different to AI learning.  Big tech are buying NVDA chips for the former. 

If Deepseek was only $6m why did the Bank of China announce last week $137nm investment into AI?

MSFT / Meta announced their new capex plans after they saw the launch of Deepseek back in Dec.  Both sticking to capex plans. 

Deepseek yet to get independent verification. 

Most big tech have record OPMs and ROIC, let’s see if they can sustain that with AI investment and their core businesses. It will take some time to know. 

Jevons’ Paradox is key - the cheaper AI is the bigger and faster the adoption / usage. 
Means more semis needed / more semi tools and more clean baseload power.

IMHO - Decent opp to buy 
TSMC

[29/01/2025, 00:36:02] ~ Zac Bobolakis: FWIW I think (1) AI long game and a lot of capital will be allocated well, a lot of capital will be wasted. The race is to pick the winners. (2) Current narrative/pricing implies some winners are nearly given. (3) Some have monopoly (asml), others very big lead (nvda, tsmc), others apparent oligopoly (OpenAI, Anthropic, hyperscalers) (4) $6m is misleading but also not the point - if deepseek said they'd spent 6bn it would still challenge the current narrative (5) "they have GPUs they are not supposed to have" is a legalistic argument that ignores the reality that GPUs are a commodity, a previous one but a commodity - you can't smuggle an asml machine but GPUs move around the world with a little more difficulty than Russian oil. (6) Selloff positioning driven- true but many bad ones are. (7) Some assumptions hold as strongly as they did a week ago (eg ASML's monopoly for now)
[29/01/2025, 00:40:46] ~ Zac Bobolakis: But the key one (8) the assumption that successful technology and business models of providing AI will look exactly like OpenAI or that it will require the full very expensive vertical is not a given. This was not priced in.
[29/01/2025, 00:43:17] ~ Zac Bobolakis: I don't expect the hyperscalers to change spending patterns. But they are  no doubt exploring other options.

[29/01/2025, 15:48:06] ~ Dipesh Patel: Briefly on SBUX.. what a gift this move is. While the headline nos may be slightly better, it's glaringly obvious they have a real issue. US footfall -8%, LFL only -4% so they're managing this well so far, but China -6% and losing share fast. Mgt think they can still double no of stores in coming years.... not a chance. They're removing discounts to help margins but that was their tactic to get people back to the chain. They've also committed to no price rises !? Not sure how they'll grow again. CEO did say they are getting better machines to help their baristas make drinks faster, so the fewer people in the restaurants have less waiting times! 😅. Meanwhile is anyone looking at Arabica prices!?

[29/01/2025, 16:02:52] ~ JB: The call was bizarre. All about the crafted personalised coffee handover within 4 mins. 

At what point do higher ASPs lead to less customers? 

Average  Op profit /store is down 40% from peak.

No mention of the $ capital investment required in stores roll out / refurb / Technology / more staff and wages 

Nor any post tax ROIC numbers on that investment or for the business overall.  

FCF conversion vs EBITDA has fallen to 38%

Coffee prices at all time highs 

Resonable DCF 6% sales growth to terminal of 2% / 16% EBIT Margin / capex = depreciation / 8% Wacc gives $60 / share. 

2025 will be a down year -10% eps all for 35x PE
[29/01/2025, 16:07:56] ~ Dipesh Patel: Specifically in that space.... Shake Shack looks rich to me and has probably done what it can short term. Think luxury played out last year (more due to demographics than product) but feel there are big shifts playing out. Brand apathy ref Nike again last year, shift to ON. Does Tesla (not withstanding the opportunity as well) need more to make it desirable again🤷🏽‍♂️... think it'll struggle as is. Only Apple holding up as a low product innovation provider with consumer love still there. Suspect MSFT product side could be weak today.

[29/01/2025, 16:12:06] ~ Noam Gottesman: On SBUX- 
Hate the coffee and at 105 wouldn’t buy it but also not sure it’s a short. 

CEO is a good operator so I wouldn’t bet against him. Also with china improving they have more of a tailwind. 
China improved from -14 to -6, so gotta look at direction

Do have store runway, probably can’t double 

On beans only 10-15% of product and distribution costs, which are 31% of revs (so 3-4% cost bucket), they typically hold 9-18 months of inventory, they hedge coffee prices, and they own farms
[29/01/2025, 16:16:26] ~ Dipesh Patel: Agree with the difficult short. The FT ran an article in Nov saying unusually SBUX doesn't appear to have hedged for 2025/26 (or hardly much) hence my thoughts on the impact. My sense is they've for niggles everywhere v agreed a solid new CEO with a track record. Chipotle had more runway in my view than SBUX does today. We'll only know over 12m but it's not going to blow up for sure.

Smiths has tailwinds in this area for the next 3 years as they replace their entire fleet of detection machines at airports around the world. 

I wonder what’s going to happen when this company is  spun out as an individual entity ?

My guess is that they will want to add to their portfolio of devices , screening people at stadia and offices , they will also want to screen for cargo and people and narcotics at the border . 

Evlv and osi systems would fit perfectly as they all cover different areas of the market .  

It’s not immediately obvious . But this is super bullish for OSI Systems and Evlv . ‎<This message was edited>
[31/01/2025, 08:35:06] Nick finegold: Smiths market cap £6.3bn 35% of that number is security . Evlv market cap $600m Osis market cap $3bn. They sort of fit perfectly together . Synergies on R&D sales and general admin  would be significant as they all sell globally .

[31/01/2025, 15:30:47] Nick finegold: Dear All,

There are some interesting dynamics playing out in gold mkts now which have been gained some attention in the press. I felt it important enough to give you our perspective on it.

Much ado About Something.
 
Since the November Trump Victory, 400 Metric tons of physical gold has left London for the NY COMEX
This has resulted in a 70% increase of COMEX stockpile of gold (29.8M ounces)
Headlines ascribe this move to fear of tariff on gold imports
Headlines also ascribe this move to an arbitrage play between the UK gold spot price and the NY-based futures price (London is known for making the phys gold spot price; NY is known for the futures contracts)
The view at VON GREYERZ is that post Basel 3, banks and COMEX need more allocated/physical gold to comply with Basel Regs
Bullion Banks linked to COMEX are also openly allowed to artificially price fix (extended shorts) the gold price via daily (and massively levered) shorts against gold (short contracts are backed by 4% actual gold and 96% paper leverage)
Typically COMEX could play this short-game for decades because gold on the COMEX stayed on the COMEX as every futures contract was simply rolled over. 
BUT NOW THE GAME HAS CHANGED: Players on the COMEX are no longer rolling over their contracts, but asking for PHYSICAL DELIVERY of the gold (this is called “Open Interest” and its up 750%)
WHY are they seeking physical delivery? Because they prefer real gold over UST’s for all the obvious reasons…
What does this mean for gold? Well, now the COMEX is worrying about if it will have enough gold to continue its perma-short on gold. Less artificial (but legal) gold shorting means a rising gold price
The UK, meanwhile, has less gold on its books now to lease/lend against gold, which means the premium for gold will go higher and the UK’s traditional role as gold-lease-lend player is weakening
In short, gold demand is rising and gold supply (in the banks, COMEX etc) is tightening—all good for gold.
And all boils down to less interest trust in sovereign debt and debased fiat—all part of our gold story at VON GREYERZ for years…

I hope this perspective is helpful and I remain at your disposition for any questions you may have.

Wishing you a fine weekend.

Best
Jonny

[31/01/2025, 16:12:42] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Thanks Nick - and to Jonny as well. Clarification question: Zooming into the key driver here, i.e. futures holders asking for physical delivery because they are worried. Which type of worry dominates here? Rates worry (they could move to shorter duration Ts, keep the futures and remain liquid)? USD weakening worry? Or something more dramatic? Thx for any thoughts.
[31/01/2025, 16:13:25] Nick finegold: I will let Jonny answer that as I am as thick as a post
[31/01/2025, 16:56:00] ~ Matt H: Yep. Physical settlement has always been in people’s minds. The amount of gold traded daily is 5x what is in vaults. If everyone wants physical then gold will go to the moon. I have been involved for 20 years and it’s never happened. That doesn’t mean it won’t
[31/01/2025, 17:03:07] ~ Ed Farquhar: https://open.substack.com/pub/1035capitalmanagement/p/cadiz-not-your-grandmothers-water?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web
[31/01/2025, 17:07:53] Nick finegold: From Adam 

Telsa derives around 80% of its revenues from autos, yet we believe 80% of the value of the company (and 100% of the upside) is non-auto. We have long felt Tesla has used the auto industry as a ‘laboratory’ to develop competency in software, manufacturing, compute, supply chain and infrastructure that can be applied to a wide range of physical industries. As genAI moves into the agentic phase, the changes to Tesla’s business and valuation are significant as well as nuanced.

[31/01/2025, 17:13:54] ~ Ben Finegold: Adam asked a few times on LiDAR in the earnings call. Musk notoriously anti LiDAR. He also spoke in detail on autonomous driving. Transcript is well worth a read. 

I bought OUST for the first time in a while this week. Margins gone from -2% in 2023 to 38% last Q on ~$30m revenues. String a few of those together and they should be FCF breakeven.

Think automation could be as integrated to our daily lives as AI. OUST fastest growing segment is robotics and then smart cities so it does have exposure to autonomous driving. Sector is quite consolidated only 3 major players and seems OUST has strongest balance sheet. No real view on tech.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753185-tesla-inc-tsla-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript
[31/01/2025, 17:14:14] ~ Jonny Haycock: To my mind the core concern is a rate concern. As / if demand for USTs continue to weaken, yields rise and the cost of debt gets out of the control of the Fed— until the Fed steps in with mega QE, ycc or even capital controls.

Everything hinges on the bond market imho
[31/01/2025, 17:16:33] ~ Ben Finegold: Musk anti LiDAR for cars but uses them at SpaceX:

“SpaceX Dragon docks with the space station using LiDAR that a program that I've personally spearheaded. I don't have some fundamental bizarre dislike of LiDAR. It's simply the wrong solution for driving cars on roads.”

[01/02/2025, 11:03:57] ~ Andrew Draycott: Indian budget today

Significant fiscal stimulus announced.


The Finance Minister certainly kept the biggest surprise for last—announcing zero income tax for individuals earning up to INR 12,00,000 per year. This is a game-changer. To put it in perspective, here in the UK—where the cost of living is nearly five times higher on a PPP basis—the tax-free allowance is roughly the same on an absolute basis at GBP 12k!

It seems the market and analysts haven’t fully absorbed the impact yet, as reflected in the erratic stock movements. But I see this as a masterstroke to fuel consumption, particularly discretionary spending. Imagine a young couple in a Tier 2 city earning a combined INR 24,00,000 (~USD28k) annually, with every rupee available for spending or saving. I would guess over 75% of salaried inviduals will be below this threshold and now pay nothing in taxes (legally).
[01/02/2025, 11:07:10] ~ Mark Lewis: If I’ve missed it above then apologies, but have we talked about the impact of Trump’s putting 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
[01/02/2025, 11:11:24] ~ Mark Lewis: Mexico and Canada are the first and third largest sources of origin respectively of imports into the US.

Mexico = 16%
China = 15%
Canada = 14%

So, Trump is about to put a 25% tariff on 30% of US imports. 

I’m not sure there is a precedent for this in history, never mind since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the rise of inflation. 

But 25% tariffs on 30% imports on $1trn of imports will cause a massive spike in inflation. As in, MASSIVE.
[01/02/2025, 11:13:34] ~ Mark Lewis: Maybe Trump’s plan is shock and awe and he is betting 🇲🇽 and 🇨🇦 back down on whatever it is he wants them to do so that he can remove the tariffs quickly and claim a win. 

But what if that doesn’t happen and the tariffs stay in place for several months? 

Good luck with Fed cuts later in the year. Interest rates will be going up not down and the US will finally get the hard landing that has been avoided for so long.
[01/02/2025, 11:14:46] ~ Mark Lewis: I guess we have to wait and see exactly how wide in scope the tariffs are and the gems and conditions but markets seem incredibly complacent about this to me.
[01/02/2025, 11:15:04] ~ Mark Lewis: *terms and conditions

[01/02/2025, 11:17:52] ~ David Haysey: Any inflationary hit from tariffs is one off and other things being equal depressive of demand. It isn’t obvious that tariffs therefore necessitate higher interest rates.

How does that not have an effect on inflation?
[01/02/2025, 11:27:03] ~ David Haysey: It does raise headline inflation at the point of imposition, but it’s a one off and like a tax rise is itself destructive of demand and an economic negative. Higher rates are also an economic negative so to impose them because a government enacts a move that has a cooling effect on the economy is not necessarily an obvious move. If an existing tariff is reduced that isn’t an argument to reduce rates. Remember the Fed has a dual mandate.

[01/02/2025, 11:29:12] ~ Zac Bobolakis: So, putting aside any response from the target countries, this is indeed inflationary but not in a way that a tighter Fed policy can control. Trying to think how this differs from e.g. a selective VAT rate (or whatever they call it) increase and seems equivalent to me. The response of the economy ranges between (a) no fall in unit consumption -> v inflationary (b) no increase in $ spending -> unit contraction. In reality somewhere in between so some inflation and some contraction, with the cash going to the Treasury. The contractionary effect of the price rises probably outweighs any Fed action. In any case, Fed is prob stuck... To be clear, I am not suggesting recession, just lower growth (and higher prices). Ofc we don't know what else follows, either by Can/Mex/CH, or by the US gov. ‎<This message was edited>

Not sure what he wants from Canada. 

But what we can all be sure about is that none of this will have been thought through.

[01/02/2025, 11:56:43] ~ Mark Lewis: And Zac is right, who knows how MX and CAD react? Trump just seems to be assuming that the US can do whatever it wants and everybody else will just have to suck it up.

[01/02/2025, 13:12:57] ~ Tom Wiggin: Simpleton view :  if tariffs cause a spike in product price (to the consumer) for product derived from a single market (in this case CN and MX),  then that same product from another source does not necessarily increase in price until such time that demand causes it to.  So in this case, food and oil accessibility/availability from elsewhere will decide size of the inflationary effect.  Bad news for the producer suffering the tariff,  good news for the producer who doesn’t (who presumably was delivering a more expensive product in the 1st place).  Net net = price inflation for sure but not necessarily severe and not necessarily instant.
[01/02/2025, 13:16:38] ~ Tom Wiggin: I suspect Trump math says that the alternative producer is or could be good ole America - and therefore may see his policy as a perverse form of  potential growth stimulus.
[01/02/2025, 13:25:27] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Yes, agreed, outcome likely somewhere in-between. Substitution depends on availability and whether like for like. Eg Canadian crude v different to US/other crude so refineries in the US  who process Can oil will have issues. Onshoring obv growth positive but takes time. The intertemporal frictions and risks...
[01/02/2025, 13:27:22] Nick finegold: Assuming the second choice domestic producer doesn’t price gauge .
[01/02/2025, 13:33:03] ~ Tom Wiggin: All agreed and hence my preface :  “simpletons view”.    The complexities are many and varied but I suspect those complexities need to (at least begin to) emerge for markets to react  definitively.

[01/02/2025, 13:49:52] ~ Mark Lewis: I think the basic point is that Mexico and Canada can export the stuff they do to the US because they are closer than anyone else (and everyone else is faraway) so are by definition going to be cheaper.

[01/02/2025, 14:44:03] ~ Julius: Trump wants Mexico to align on 3 things: 
1. Trade (Mexico imports a lot of parts from China and reexports to the US)
2. ⁠Immigration 
3. ⁠Drugs

Mexico have signalled and are already implementing policies showing will align on 1 and 2. 

3 is the sticking point - this Mexican govt has had a policy of “hugs not bullets”. People I speak to in Mex have bad memories of violence last time they took on the cartels head on under Felipe Calderon. It’s also quite possible the politicians are deep in the pockets of the cartels - the govt have just passed a judicial reform that appears very beneficial to the cartels.

Mexican stocks and the peso held up pretty well yesterday after the announcement, but both have already sold off quite strongly last year, I think most people were expecting it. The key unknown remains how quickly they can get to a deal.

[01/02/2025, 16:59:27] Nick finegold: I fed all of todays comments into chat GPT and asked it for its opinion on the impact of tariffs based on your comments but it could ingest millions of data points 

. I am sure it has occurred to you all that this technology can predict a more accurate vision of the economy and how to manage it ? Reducing the number of economists in the world . 

No industry is going to suffer more change than asset management . 

Here is its answer or all of yours neatly summarised . 

In my view, U.S. tariffs on key trade partners like Mexico and Canada will almost certainly result in short-term inflation. However, the longer-term consequences depend on several factors: the availability of alternative suppliers, the resilience of supply chains, and how long these tariffs remain in place.

Here’s how I see the key points:

1. Initial Inflation Spike
	•	With tariffs on 30% of U.S. imports, particularly food and oil, prices will increase. These sectors affect both consumers directly (groceries, fuel) and indirectly (transportation, manufacturing costs).
	•	Since food and energy prices are major components of headline inflation, the tariffs will drive inflation up temporarily.

2. Limited Ability to Substitute
	•	Mexico and Canada are key suppliers because of proximity and established supply chains. Alternatives—either domestic or from other countries—are unlikely to fully meet demand quickly.
	•	For example, U.S. refineries optimized for Canadian crude may face higher costs adapting to other sources of oil. Similarly, perishable food products from other countries may face logistical challenges.

3. Fed Response
	•	I doubt the Federal Reserve will immediately raise rates. The Fed typically views tariff-driven inflation as a “supply shock,” which does not require monetary tightening unless it becomes entrenched.
	•	However, if tariffs persist for a year or longer, inflation expectations could shift upward. In that case, the Fed may face pressure to act, complicating any plans to cut rates to stimulate growth.

4. Economic Cooling Effect
	•	Tariffs act like a tax increase. As prices rise, consumers may reduce spending, especially on discretionary goods. Businesses facing higher input costs might cut investments or lay off workers.
	•	This demand reduction could partially offset inflationary pressures but at the cost of slower economic growth. I expect GDP growth to slow, though not necessarily enter a full recession unless other shocks occur (e.g., retaliatory tariffs).

5. Trump’s Strategy and Risk
	•	I agree with the speculation that Trump sees tariffs as a negotiating tactic. If Mexico and Canada comply quickly, he may lift tariffs, minimizing long-term damage.
	•	The risk is that this approach underestimates how long negotiations might take or how resistant these countries could be, particularly if domestic politics in Mexico or Canada prevent quick concessions. If tariffs last longer than expected, both inflation and supply chain disruptions will intensify.

6. Market Complacency
	•	Markets do seem under-prepared for the potential fallout. There may be assumptions that tariffs will be short-lived or that substitutes will emerge quickly. However, as seen with other trade conflicts (e.g., U.S.-China), disruptions can last longer and be more impactful than anticipated.
	•	Investors should be cautious, particularly in sectors reliant on trade with Mexico and Canada. Companies in these industries may face higher costs and earnings pressure.

Summary:
I believe the tariffs will cause a temporary but sharp inflation spike. If negotiations drag on, we could see both inflation and slower growth. The Fed might initially hold rates steady, but prolonged tariffs could force it into a difficult position. Markets and businesses should prepare for heightened uncertainty, as the complexities of global supply chains cannot be quickly untangled. This is a significant risk that should not be underestimated.

[03/02/2025, 08:58:09] ~ Ben Finegold: Am doing some work this morning and will share but consider Russia / Kazakhstan account for 50% of nuclear fuel imports in the U.S.

I think 25% for Canada but will revert
[03/02/2025, 10:43:46] ~ Mark Lewis: According to EIA website, Canada is most important source of US Uranium imports, accounting for 11m lbs (27% of all import) in 2022:

[03/02/2025, 11:06:04] ~ Ben Finegold: We have been tracking in detail Kazakh uranium exports, 75% of which now either go to Russia / China / or stay domestically. 

Importantly, the U.S. produced <500,000 lbs domestically last year versus ~50m lbs of domestic annual requirements (<1%). I fear Trump does not understand uranium, there is no uranium tap, or uranium fields, he can expedite licensing for mines yes, but the U.S. are so incredibly far away from being self sufficient it is scary. It certainly does not feel like a time to be pissing off Canada as we viewed Canada as the only friendly option the U.S. has left with real uranium production capabilities. 

Nuclear powers 20% of the U.S. grid and accounts for 55% of clean energy. 

Names you can own on the back of these tariffs with US uranium assets are UEC, enCore Energy, Peninsula, Ur-Energy. Centrus will likely do well but reminder they rely on Russia for 85% of revenues.
[03/02/2025, 11:22:17] ~ William Nutting: Uranium is one thing and 100% agree but think about the 🥑 avocado! (80% from mexico)…
[03/02/2025, 11:27:23] ~ Dipesh Patel: Thanks Ben. So does this mean US power providers will have to pay 25% more on 25% of their raw materials assuming they are not price makers. Just hurts them. Not sure what other readacross there is for Uraniun / Uranium plays specifically unless we assume that Russian/Kaz start to play dirty ie want higher prices or restrict supply which is also an issue for power producers?

In 2023, sales to the americas from Cameco represented 48.4% of sales. In 2024, 44.9%. I would assume the majority of that is to the U.S.

UNDERSTANDING TRUMP: 
Trump sees all dealmaking as what you might call "distributive bargaining." Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you're fighting over who gets how many pieces. 
The other type of bargaining is called “integrative bargaining”. In integrative bargaining the two sides don't have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.

We think these are volatile times and the company benefits greatly from that volatility in a risk free manner . Please take a look at the showcase above if you wish to learn more.  But we are trying to do a better job of nailing down key ideas and presenting them clearly .

[06/02/2025, 07:07:17] ~ JB: Google CEO said on the call they have more demand than capacity hence the need for more data centres and 7 new subsea cable projects.  Cloud division saw 30% sales growth and 142% Op profit growth with margin 17.5% close to record highs.  It would all have been higher with more capacity.  Google has the flexibility to use this extra capacity across all its businesses. The stats on usage / developers were very strong.  Core services business operating margin also jumped to 39%. 

A vanilla DCF with sensible axioms gets one to $300. 
14x 2027 PE for 18% eps CAGR. 

Google also has a lot of hidden value - WAYMO / QUantum computing et al.

Rev run rate for YouTube / GCP is now $110bn or 31% of total.

EVERYONE WANTS PHYSICAL GOLD: Gosh I can’t think why!? $3000 beckons and see overnight in Asia gold to $2860. Asia, it seems is now cleaned out of physical, Comex participants are demanding physical, London is
cleaned out, and there's now seemingly a run on the Bank of England's vault. Yes, 53 years of trust in fiat is coming to a shuddering halt! I have a chart of 1mth forward Gold borrowing costs and it is a WOW! ‎<This message was edited>

[06/02/2025, 09:49:59] ~ William Nutting: SELL GOOGL : Honestly committing to $75 billion in capex next year will be equal to roughly 70% of its
operating cash flows. The GOOGL long thesis has always been about owning a monopolised, high-margin toll
road on 90% of internet traffic and printing cash. This is the very opposite of that. If a business MUST spend
billions and billions every year on major tech upgrades, shouldn’t those expenses be included as a line item on
its income statement? If you capitalise “costs” oh sorry not they are investments ($52bn) thats more than 50%
of its profit. A business that isn't earning any real profit for its owners, that's only growing at 14% a year, and
that requires more than $100 billion a year in cap ex and buybacks, might be worth 12 or 14 times earnings. It
isnt worth 25x. Last year, Google spent $52 billion on capital investments. As you can see, that’s a major
portion of the money it made (more than 50%!) If you look at real “costs” of Google’s business they wouldn’t
have made $100 billion last year they would have lost $14 billion. (Expensing investments and costs associated
with Option dilution etc) Judging Google on an after-capital investments basis would leave you with a paltry
14% ROE, consider that vs Peers. Never forget: US accounting standards were originally developed for the the
Pennsylvania Railroad, where capital investments in new tracks, new stations, and new bridges (150 years
ago!) would in fact be used profitably for decades, pron not the case with Nvidia chips! If these tech upgrades
were treated as expenses, then Google’s business would look a lot different: Google would have made less
than half as much money last year – only $48 billion on sales of $350 billion (rather than $100 billion), for a net
income margin of only 13%.
There's honestly no reason to pay 25x earnings for a business everyone is so universally bullish on, (how many
Sell ratings?!) funnelling 70% of cash flow into a capex blackhole. It wasn't long ago that META traded down to
9x earnings when it went through the same debacle with the metaverse. SAMSUNG is at 10X vs GOOGL @25 X.
(that said was THE buying point for META!) Now it may be stretching things a little, but to drill a lateral, “airlines: we
can increase our production while spending all our earnings and our stocks will go up right?” interesting chart
(tx bbg and thankyou the Madeira Group!)

The issue is surely can they earn a return on that capex (an issue for the whole hyprscaler sector) . What if AI end up a ‘free’ utility like search?
[06/02/2025, 10:54:18] ~ William Nutting: I said a stretch, but you make the same point. Alternative thinking badly needed even without web 3.0 blockchain disruption coming.

Adjusted EBITDA rose 28% YoY to $471M, and net income surged to $1.85B, largely due to a $1.6B tax benefit. The company repurchased $100M in shares and continues to focus on lower-funnel advertising growth and international expansion.

BABA +6% (again) on speculation that BABA will invest $1bn for a 10% stake in Deepseek, at a $10bn valuation.
On where consensus is crowded; US HYPERSCALERS: “I’d rather have a Chinese!”
BIG 5=AVOID “Either chips stocks are absurdly cheap or someone is lying! “
For the top 4 so far that's a combined $325 billion in CapEx for FY25 alone.

The Serious point on Markets here is that as all the crowded big stale index caves get bombed its suddenly a good time for the likes of Armitage @ Egerton Terry Smith etc and am sure many others etc who have been held back by not having had massive bets in likes of Nvidia etc when they knew it wasnt what their clients paid them for but at the same time low cost index funds were kicking their backsides…(please send me any more I should flag) 
“Active & Conviction & Contrarian” should now be focus alongside Gold ( be careful s-term if more peace) and Blockchain ( but get the very best ( IMHO Max and/or George!) to manage that for you and seriously take a 3-5 yr view) … 
By the way, YES, again start to think about WHAT IF’s?! Start to Think of the Markets reactions to a Ukraine Ceasefire fire.
Nutstuff had some excellent thoughts and I did a full piece at start of 2025.  I have updated a list of thing's to do ( for subscribers) and interestingly The SHRUB and me agree on a couple of ideas too! ( that always reassures).

[09/02/2025, 12:06:09] Nick finegold: Ok it’s superbowl day and having named my fourth child Jet after the most losing  franchise in NFL history , my advice is do the opposite of whatever I suggest . 
It’s a tough one to call , my heart is with the Eagles . 

Super Bowl Rundown – Investment Club Edition

Too Close to Call

This year’s Super Bowl is a razor-thin matchup. Let’s break it down by strengths and weaknesses for both teams.

The Eagles – The All-Round Machine

The Eagles are a better-balanced team across almost every metric:
	•	Offensive Line: Dominant protection and run blocking.
	•	Wide Receivers: Outclassing the Chiefs’ unit.
	•	Running Game: Headlined by Barkley, they’re far superior.
	•	Secondary: A solid unit capable of handling opposing passing attacks.

The Problem? The Chiefs still have three world-class factors in their favor:
	1.	Patrick Mahomes: Arguably the best quarterback in the game.
	2.	Andy Reid: A mastermind coach (and former Eagles coach), who’ll be desperate to beat his old team.
	3.	Steve Spagnuolo: A defensive coordinator with a reputation for stepping up in big games.

Chiefs: Strengths and Weaknesses
	•	Chiefs have benefited from facing weaker opponents this year, often with injured offensive lines.
	•	Their defense might be overrated, having looked stronger than it really is against those weaker teams.
	•	Turnovers: Eagles are 20-2 in turnover ratio over the last six games. Will they keep that up?
	•	Mahomes Playoff Record: 8-0 as either an underdog or with a small (-3 or less) spread.

Other Key Trends:
	•	Chiefs have appeared in four recent Super Bowls and have never led at halftime—yet they’ve won three of them.
	•	Eagles may control time of possession, which could keep Mahomes off the field for long stretches.

Betting Insights

I’ll be keeping stakes lower than usual since…
Fact: My Super Bowl betting record is very poor.

However, here are some trends and opportunities to watch:
	•	Teams that scored 40+ points in the conference final: Just 3-7 in Super Bowls.
	•	Team scoring last: Has won the last 18 straight Super Bowls.

Best Value Bet

Halftime/Full-Time Bet:
	•	Eagles to lead at halftime, Chiefs to win full-time at 11-2 odds. This bet plays off the Chiefs’ history of second-half comebacks and their slow starts in recent Super Bowls.

Let’s see how this wild matchup plays out! ‎<This message was edited>

[10/02/2025, 11:26:03] ~ Mark Lewis: Up 42% in last two weeks. 

Why?
[10/02/2025, 11:28:52] ~ Mark Lewis: ‎This message was deleted.
[10/02/2025, 11:29:13] ~ Mark Lewis: Because the UK Government wants to link the UK carbon market with the EU carbon market. 

And UKAs — even after the huge rally of the last 2 weeks — are still trading at a massive discount to EUAs. EUAs trading €83.5/t, UKAs trading at £48.5/t or €58.2/t
[10/02/2025, 11:30:22] ~ Mark Lewis: If the forthcoming UK/EU trade and cooperation talks produce a breakthrough on linking carbon markets, then the market will close that €25/t discount very significantly
[10/02/2025, 11:33:01] ~ Mark Lewis: Background here, this is what caused the huge run-up in last two weeks:
[10/02/2025, 11:34:05] ~ Mark Lewis: Keir Starmer looks to link UK and EU emission trading schemes  https://on.ft.com/3CuUJgb
[10/02/2025, 11:35:54] ~ Mark Lewis: If the UK and EU can link their carbon markets then Starmer can start making a more positive case gir a broader reset of UK/EU relations.
[10/02/2025, 11:36:32] Nick finegold: What would happen to the carbon price ?
[10/02/2025, 11:36:47] Nick finegold: Who has the credits that would benefit ?
[10/02/2025, 11:36:52] Nick finegold: Please ?
[10/02/2025, 11:37:57] ~ William Nutting: Heavy industries (e.g., cement, steel, and chemicals manufacturers)
	•	Energy companies and power generators
	•	Aviation sector (which is facing removal of free EUA allocations)
	•	Maritime sector (which is being phased into the ETS)
[10/02/2025, 11:39:11] ~ Mark Lewis: And as the Clarkson revelation shows, there is massive lent-up demand in the UK for reversing Brexit or at least the worst aspects of it. And there is only so Long Farage and Badenoch will be able to run away from the catastrophic impact of Brexit. That’s why Clarkson’s intervention is so symbolically important. 2029 is going to be another Brexit election.
[10/02/2025, 11:39:52] ~ Mark Lewis: @⁨Nick finegold⁩ Maybe it’s Clarkson you should be inviting tk speak to the club rather than Farage. 🤗
[10/02/2025, 11:41:10] ~ Mark Lewis: Errrr, the clue was when I said that the current massive discount to EUAs would close — so, UKAs still looking a very good bet despite the 40% rally of the last two weeks.

[10/02/2025, 12:29:42] ~ JB: ATC PZ - cheapest play on music.

 ATC has released a trading statement showing a record year of organic growth and successful acquisitions.

We have seen the first signs of operational leverage with a return to positive EBITDA.

There is much more to come.

Revenue has doubled to circa £50m and EBITDA of £1.5m puts the shares on just 0.3x Sales and 10x EBITDA 2024 numbers.

Success has been broad based the 3 divisions, and the outlook is very strong for 2025 and beyond.

ATC now has relationships with 860 artists across 1080 business engagements (you can see exactly which ones on the new IR website https://www.atcgroupplc.com/).

The strategy is to add more artists and to provide more services to all of them.

Alignment with the artists remain key.  As music artists get back their master rights, ATC is the perfect platform for them to monetise their art across the many possible channels.

ATC is increasing using data analytics in advising their artists where to focus.

Importantly, ATC is looking to move to the LSE to improve liquidity for shareholders.

In short, this is just the beginning.

ATC remains one of the cheapest ways to play the structural growth trends in the music industry.

[10/02/2025, 14:33:10] ~ Mark Lewis: The UK farming industry as a bloc voted in favour of Brexit. Brexit has greatly impoverished the UK. So the Govt is forced to think about new ways of raising taxes to make up for the lost tax revenue caused by the lower GDP caused by Brexit. 

British politics has been so intellectually dishonest since the Brexit vote but at some point it is going to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. 

And that’s why Clarkson is such an interesting straw in the wind here.
[10/02/2025, 14:49:55] ~ Mark Lewis: Not to mention that the CAP is possibly the most egregiously rigged policy in favour of producers in the history of the world. 

How on Earth did they think they were ever going to get a better deal outside the EU in an overwhelmingly urban country? 

There are many Brexit delusions, but that one takes some beating.
[10/02/2025, 15:01:35] ~ Jacco Reijtenbagh: Why are you all discussing the UK joining the most overregulated shit show on earth? The UK needs to get its house in order by itself. It should focus less on Europe and more towards the rest of the world. Things it did before it joined the EU. The UK is the worlds oldest trading nation, from its island origins. It needs to promote and invigorate these items. The UK needs to split and move in another direction than Europe which it hasn't been doing. It's been increasing regulation instead of doing the opposite what people voted on. Deregulation creates jobs. We have the examples of Argentina vs the rest of South America and US vs Canada. The UK needs to adopt and change. It is not the same as continental Europe and should not want to be continental Europe.
[10/02/2025, 15:02:47] Nick finegold: A  polite reminder to all that the primary purpose of this group is alpha generation and whilst I respect all of your opinions and their wisdom , it’s just helpful if we use this group to generate as many great ideas as possible . We are working hard to separate those ideas and present them all more clearly to you through our club showcases and shareflix so that they can travel virally . Thanks so much love Nick
[10/02/2025, 16:05:17] Nick finegold: On the Gold price . Not much about the Chinese insurance industry being able to hold Gold on the asset side their balance sheets in the weekend press. 

I texted Claire at the World Gold Council  and I think they are preparing a measured response to alert investors and provide some details which we will highlight when it comes out . 

In the meantime , I bought a few Barrick last week , no particular reason other than at some stage one would hope that the gold price hitting new highs will drag the laggards up , Newmont and Barrick have had their fair share of problems but at some stage they should hit escape velocity if gold holds or goes on from here .

[10/02/2025, 17:09:24] Nick finegold: Mobileye +15% but what caught my eye was the Japanese company that’s providing the autonomous car fleet,  which certainly is Tesla ! 

Lyft stock was rising Monday after the company revealed that it would launch self-driving robotaxis in collaboration with Mobileye “as soon as 2026.” The ride-hailing company plans to bring fully autonomous robotaxis powered by the Mobileye Drive system to its app as early as next year. Marubeni a Japanese conglomerate, will provide the robotaxi fleet.

Uber and lyft have been hit hard on fears of autonomy , not sure that’s a great call when they lose their biggest overheads .
[10/02/2025, 18:10:11] ~ Neil Shah: Veon initiation - turnaround story. DCF delivers a fair value of $56.5/share, 32% upside to the current share price. VEON trades on 3.5x FY26e EV/EBITDA, 20% below the average of its peers and 8.0x FY26e P/E, 25% below peers. We estimate that VEON will pay a $3.02 dividend on 2026 earnings, giving a 7.0% yield. If you/the club would like an intro, please let me know.

[12/02/2025, 10:57:19] ~ Simon Brewer: As a boring 30 year + gold investor.  The expected pattern will be gdx and the big caps break out of multi year bear markets, with violent set backs along the way.  Then the second tier and juniors follow and as speculative juices flow any man with a shovel and a story looks compelling to retail.  That’s a long way ahead.  I have a ladder of overweight majors then miss and royalties  and a basket of speculative names.  The m cap of the whole space is so tiny and institutional allocations largely absent.  I think the Blackrock gold aums are 1/3 of their peak 15 years ago.
[12/02/2025, 11:08:00] ~ Robert: So Northern Dynasty is resurrected from the dead and becomes the ultimate “Industrialise Alaska” gold and copper play. Stranger things will happen in Trumpland.
[12/02/2025, 11:20:06] Nick finegold: The whole industry is underweight , both physical and the stocks. 

What fascinated me about the WGC when they first spoke to us is their plans for golds digitisation backed by physical gold on the block chain . For want of a better description Bitcoins with value or stable coins in a different guise that can be fractionally owned  . It’s a story we first heard almost 2 years ago and yet I have never heard a single gold bug mention the WGC’s plans for golds  future . 

That’s partly down to the WGC not being prepared to market the plan out loud until they are further advanced.

If and when this starts to happen gold will become far more attractive to  a new generation of investors. 

The WGC have enormous marketing clout , but the fundamentally the story remains the same for the time being which is buy if you think the worlds troubled . That’s a hugely important part of the narrative but it only appeals to those with money to protect , not those looking to accumulate wealth.

I said a year ago I think when this happens good can go to $10000 and I stand by that .
[12/02/2025, 11:31:44] ~ Philip Donald: Re….it only appeals to those with money to protect , not those looking to accumulate wealth…….From the beginning of 2000 to the mid-2020s, gold investments have multiplied ninefold, outpacing the S&P 500’s sixfold increase.

[12/02/2025, 11:40:54] Nick finegold: For those interested . 

TORONTO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD)(TSX:ABX) delivered a strong performance in Q4, increasing gold production by 15% and copper production by 33% over Q3 to meet its annual guidance for the year. Additionally, gold cost of sales1 and total cash costs2 for the quarter were reduced by 3% and 5%, respectively.

The results for the year, released today, report a 69% increase in net earnings to $2.14 billion, a 51% increase in adjusted net earnings3 to $2.21 billion and a 30% rise in attributable EBITDA4 to $5.19 billion for 2024 — the highest in over a decade. Year-on-year operating cash flow increased 20% to $4.49 billion and free cash flow5 more than doubled to $1.32 billion, driven by the stronger earnings. A quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share was maintained, bringing the total annual dividend paid to shareholders to $696 million, and a further $498 million was returned in buying back shares.

[12/02/2025, 16:25:30] ~ Dipesh Patel: Have to say great call to Will as well for stopping anyone selling a share of it. Too easy to do. I suspect it'll win the stk comp !! It also feels like in a better place than ASPI which I think Nutstuff did flag.
[12/02/2025, 16:27:02] ~ Ben Finegold: We are fans of both but to manage expectations LTBR will not commercialise fuel for likely 5-6 years. Potential to expedite that a bit under a slightly deregulated nuclear industry in the US but it remains in R&D phase.
[12/02/2025, 16:36:27] ~ Dipesh Patel: Thanks.. you know my reservations about ASPI though as well. Most of nuclear has the ability to kick deliverables constantly down the track so for all of them you have to have some hope and patience in the mix. I think LTBR has a US advantage ref Oklo etc. In my mind it has yet to start having questions asked about it unlike ASPI. I'm sure it'll come for LTBR as well at some point.
[12/02/2025, 16:41:15] ~ Mark Astley: NF, it is a bigger story than protecting wealth via "safe haven" buying, as strong as that is. 
In addition, a) deglobalisation will increase diversification away from USD centric reserve management and continue to add to gold holdings - obviously China is the largest example and that is likely to be a secular move; b) ample liquidity conditions through a variety of mechanisms, declining real rates, base money and/or M2 growth. This will not be linear but CBs and Treasury depts much more likely to be monetarily liberal than restrictive (it will deetroy fiat currencies eventually which is why Bitcoin is increasingly relevant), c) the USD is at its highest level in real terms since its high in 1985 so much more likely to decline over medium term.  Also, Trump, expected to be good for USD but may be reverse; tariffs bad for growth, DOGE may reduce deficit, Bessent aiming for lower long term yields (notwithstanding sticky CPI today).

[12/02/2025, 16:43:31] Nick finegold: Their marketing budget is certainly significant
[12/02/2025, 16:44:14] ~ Mark Astley: But that would be in the "ease of access" bucket rather than "underlying driving forces" bucket...
[12/02/2025, 16:45:08] Nick finegold: Anyway I am long silver ! Which has underperformed badly vs historic correlation to gold .
[12/02/2025, 16:45:41] ~ Mark Astley: Its about to wake up...🤞
[12/02/2025, 16:46:04] Nick finegold: I hope so , we have fresnillo on our watch list for that reason
[12/02/2025, 16:46:27] Nick finegold: But as Will suggests the commodity can’t profit warn.
[12/02/2025, 16:54:43] ~ Jonny Haycock: Long before digitisation becomes a thing for gold we’re keeping a much closer eye on Bessent’s comments about monetising the asset side of the US b/s. We think the chances of him ushering in a new gold standard could be quite a bit higher than most think. If true, the entire space will explode in the next 12 months. Obviously we have no edge on this but to us it’s the most important of many new drivers of gold to consider right now.
[12/02/2025, 17:01:23] ~ Morgan: Johnny - Arthur Hayes (big name in Crypto space) wrote a long essay on this I believe
[12/02/2025, 17:01:33] ~ Mark Astley: I had not considered that - what is your logic that this may be being seriously considered..?
[12/02/2025, 17:01:54] ~ Mark Astley: Can you share the paper?  Tx
[12/02/2025, 17:02:26] ~ Morgan: https://cryptohayes.medium.com/trump-truth-fdcbd31f2e26
[12/02/2025, 17:08:40] ~ Jonny Haycock: We’re just hearing murmurs Mark, nothing more than that, from a few sources we follow but here’s one quote that sums it up….”We know that Bessent has voiced grand plans
for a revamped international monetary system less reliant on the US dollar, although the exact details
are unknown. Being a ‘sound money’ man, it is likely that he favours a role for gold and a return to
some form of ‘gold exchange standard’ (i.e. targeting a fixed bullion price, rather than tying the Fed’s
balance sheet to a given stock of gold) would unquestionably reduce the discretion and limit the role
of the Federal Reserve, thereby ticking a box. It could also bring the pricing of gold back under
America’s watchful eye and away from the murky margins of Shanghai. This would trigger a sudden
upward revaluation of bullion prices, since it more-or-less acknowledges the worthlessness of paper
money, but thereafter bullion prices would remain largely constant, assuming the US then adopted an
exchange standard based on, say, a US$3,250/oz. target.”
[12/02/2025, 17:08:52] ~ Jonny Haycock: But Mark, we could be wrong.
[12/02/2025, 17:16:19] ~ Mark Astley: Very interesting.  Tx
[12/02/2025, 17:18:30] ~ Mark Astley: ...at almost 100x the pre-Bretton Woods price...that's currency debasement on an industrial scale..
[12/02/2025, 17:23:05] ~ Morgan: Asking for a friend, what are the top 3 ways to play this Jonny?
[12/02/2025, 17:23:30] ~ Mark Astley: Notable that silver closing the day higher despite a upside CPI print and an initial sell-off...the tone of the market is looking v promising...
[12/02/2025, 17:29:01] ~ David Haysey: America is addicted to deficits and any savings on DOGE will surely go to tax cuts. A return to Bretton Woods at any level would surely mean giving up the ‘exorbitant privilege’ aspects of being the  world’s reserve currency. Trump is not a fiscal conservative or debt hawk.

[12/02/2025, 18:21:28] ~ Jonny Haycock: Well, as a few in this chat know I’m a purist and advocate buying physical gold held in my name only with zero counterparty risk. That said, I think if these events play out silver could hit $50 in 12 months time. But that entails a different level of volatility/drawdown risk.
[12/02/2025, 18:22:13] ~ Mark Astley: Your first sentence is persuasive but is probably dully discounted.  Bessent's "3,3,3" goal incl, a 3% deficit is probably not and the resulting big fiscal drag would likely hit growth and the USD hard relative to today's monster deficit.  The question then is how likely this is.
Your second point is a longer term issue clearly- I have no idea how likely that might be but a left-tail probability only I guess.
[12/02/2025, 18:22:25] ~ Mark Astley: ...fully...
[12/02/2025, 18:38:43] ~ Chris Huggins: I bought call options on Barrick. GOLD US.  

April 18 strike calls are 1.15…so with stock at 18.30 you get 20x leverage for 2 months.
[12/02/2025, 22:04:24] ~ William Nutting: BREAKING: President Trump's peace plan for Ukraine it seems has been leaked. 
It appears as though Zelensky will be informed of, BUT NOT INCLUDED IN, the US-RUSSIA peace deal negotiations.

1. Ceasefire by April 20th
2. Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO
3. Ukraine would recognize Russian sovereignty over annexed lands and withdraw troops from Kursk
4. Demilitarized zone policed by European troops with no U.S. involvement.
5. $486 billion in reconstruction assistance funded by EU
The timeline shows peace talks beginning in early February.

POSITIONING for PEACE/CEASE-FIRE: Start to Think of the Markets reactions to an Ukraine Ceasefire fire. We own VEON also some FEREXPO also (Tx Shrub) like “calls on BASF”, CCIR / Kyivstar; which will be the only listed Ukraine pure-play on the US market, so I figured it might get attention on a ceasefire, plus my downside is low ($10.50 now vs downside of $10 before the vote)

“On other side of all this early-stage Digital Asset Tokenisation stuff CONSIDER THIS…

I/we believe a Venture Capital Apocalypse is coming...it might even be here already. (Tx carriednointerest)
The venture capital asset class is facing a watershed moment. Orphaned & Zombie VC software companies are
everywhere. 1) VCs invested in businesses at lofty valuations. 2) VC. backed software acquisitions are
plummeting. 3) Down rounds are sky rocketing
All of this results in VCs not distributing much to LPs. So, where do we go from here?
1) Many VCs will likely shut down. 2) I think the top VC funds will be fine. There will always be generational
businesses founded every year. Top VCs will get the pick of the litter. They will downsize AUM. 3) Overall LP
allocation to VC will likely go down. 4) There will be many 'orphaned' VC backed software companies that
don't have a path forward in the new environment.

CROX US (and Hey Dude). An Acquired taste and specialist product!!! But fascinating to be educated by Emily ( my daughter)  about this company. It seems a 2022 acquisition of “Hey Dude” was a classic Free money era deal that has
given significant indigestion. That said the product is fantastic and at the right price point. I went to both Crocs
and Hey-Dude outlets and demand doesn’t seem to be an issue. Whatsmore CROX currently trades at 8x p.e.
And a 12% FCF, that’s way cheaper than anything I see in the space. Looking at technicals, any signs of a
stabilisation in the Hey Dude “bleed” and this might work better…10x Buy ratings, NO sells and a few Neutrals
to convert and make some noise!

[14/02/2025, 18:59:46] ~ JB: TSMC Considers Operating US Intel Factories After Trump Request

Summary by Bloomberg AI
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering taking a controlling stake in Intel Corp.'s factories at the request of Trump administration officials.
The intended result would have TSMC fully operating Intel's US semiconductor factories, addressing concerns about Intel's financial state.
The arrangement may involve major American chip designers taking equity stakes, along with support from the US government, to ensure the venture isn't solely owned by a foreign company.

02/14/2025 18:54:20 [BN]
(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering taking a controlling stake in Intel Corp.’s factories at the request of Trump administration officials, a person familiar with the matter said, as the president looks to boost American manufacturing and maintain US leadership in critical technologies. 

Trump’s team raised the idea of a deal between the two companies in recent meetings with officials from the Taiwanese chipmaker, the person said, and TSMC was receptive. It’s unclear whether Intel is open to a transaction.

[19/02/2025, 16:40:30] ~ Alex Fink: Hey All, Empirical Ventures managed to be part of Microsofts big announcement on Quantum Computing today…

Their latest breakthrough—the Majorana 1, the world’s first topological quantum chip

This is a major milestone for quantum computing. Unlike traditional qubits, which are incredibly fragile and prone to errors, Microsoft’s approach harnesses the exotic properties of Majorana quasi-particles to create more stable, scalable qubits. If successful, this could be the key to unlocking fault-tolerant quantum computing—bringing us closer to solving problems that are impossible for classical computers.

HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY MISSING FROM FORT KNOX?
 
This is how the US does QE next (see Monday’s ‘Insight’ mail for details on view on this)
 
BUT note the lease rate for gold continues to rocket ever higher (borrow costs – bottom RHC) as physical delivery demands have surged exposing derivative markets (which are a magnitude higher in volumes than that which actually ‘exists’)
 
Gold at $2930 aka another ATH shows no sign of topping out – and when (not if) vaults in Fort Knox have to be re-assessed/re-valued – this barbaric metal could go into a melt-up phase; accompanied by yields falling hard; and high BETA risk assets surging
 
What confuses as a related aside is why Bitcoin isnt partaking (yet) – remains BUY idea no.1
 
ImageImage.png
 
Source Polymarket/ZH
 
Odds of Fort Knox Gold actually missing
Gold lease rates are continuing to rocket – noone can get their hands on the ‘actual physical’
 
Which leads too - I want to remind in fixed income what we’re looking at….
 
HAMMERING OUT THE RIGHT SHOULDER NOW
 
Keep this in mind re: fixed income, because to remind we’re in a hammering out of the right shoulder phase currently which could last through till Easter (which is a steady F.I environment ahead helping risk markets (who like ‘stability’ and low vol of course in the fixed income land)
 
This pattern is negated should the ‘head’ be taken out at 4.8% (not going to happen), whilst the other way? Watch this upwards sloping neckline which is quite close b.t 4.4% and 4.45% Vs. 4.54% trading
 
The outlook?
 
If this pattern plays out? Is a sub 4% level I would expect in Q2 ’25 (and I would expect this to happen as Gold moves into that melt-up phase; and high beta equity surges)
[19/02/2025, 16:59:21] ~ JB: I agree.
[19/02/2025, 17:29:39] ~ Mark Lewis: Uranium now back to $64.3/lb, down 12% YTD and lowest level since Oct-23. 

First Deepseek, then Trump’s dovish comments about denuclearization prompting talk about megatonnes to MWh. 

This really has become a pain trade, and all this uncertainty simply pushes back the need for utilities to step in to buy unless they absolutely have to. 

Anyone see a level at which Utilities enter in size or do we just see a further drift lower on Trump coziness with Putin?
[19/02/2025, 17:49:45] ~ Dipesh Patel: Just a post war playbook playing out. Most likely no US sanctions by some point this year
[19/02/2025, 17:50:14] Nick finegold: Thanks Mark. I think you would probably have to look at an unchanged term price rather than a spot market that’s terribly thin and almost incomprehensible but it’s a well made point .
[19/02/2025, 18:03:30] ~ Ben Finegold: The disparity between spot and term is now become so great that it seems impossible we do not see a pick up in the carry trade. This disparity has to close and all the indications I can see are that term prices are only heading in one direction, so it will be spot that has to rise not term that has to fall.

In terms of upcoming catalysts, I think geopolitics will continue to provide meaningful support. A recoup between the US and Russia could be positive for two reasons:

1. It would free up some conversion capacity which will get utilities into the contracting market for U3O8 as there is now conversion capacity to sell into. There is no point in contracting U3O8 unless you can get it over to a conversion facility ASAP or else you just start to pay storage fees.

2. Potential for downblending of HEU could be a MASSIVE demand driver for U3O8. The megatons to megawatts program that you will be familiar with downblended HEU (90% enriched uranium) using A LOT of U3O8 (0.7% enriched uranium). Think about it like making Ribena. Downblending HEU (ribena concentrate) to LEU (drinkwable ribena) requires mixing HEU with U3O8 (water). Specififcally, megatons to megawatts required 150,000 tonnes over 2 decades of U3O8 to downblend HEU.
[19/02/2025, 18:06:15] ~ Ben Finegold: Spot prices have been frustrating for sure and remains the key driver of sentiment. Whether it’s right or wrong to do that is irrelevant because it’s what the market thinks matters. Term prices remains over $80 with contracts being signed with ceilings well over $100. In January, 17m lbs was contracted in the term market so a very strong start to the year. In other words utilities are contracting, it’s just not being felt in spot prices at all. ‎<This message was edited>
[19/02/2025, 18:18:18] ~ Dipesh Patel: The stocks and ETFs are not trading on term prices then clearly. The mkt is definitely getting hit whether that is a Uranium ETF or something like UEC. To me it's just pricing in sentiment around a number of dynamics including a potentially different positioning for Russia. In the short term in what are thinly traded at times stocks/ETFs and spot Uranium that is bound to come with big moves..
[19/02/2025, 18:32:13] ~ Mark Lewis: Fair point on term price, Nick, but unfortunately the equity names (especially the trusts) trade versus spot price.

[19/02/2025, 20:09:31] Nick finegold: I usually like to summarise an article so you folks do t have to read it , but this a tough one to summarise . 

It’s basically saying you just can’t prove how much gold is in Fort Knox and what ever gold happens to be there has already been promised or sold many times , which might explain why it’s never been marked up ? Worth a read. It’s an old article but it’s super interesting if not a little tough to follow . ‎<This message was edited>

Mistakes much more likely from selling brokers, although fraud pretty rare. And of course there are lots of boiler room scams flogging fine wine and whisky investment….
Worth mentioning fine wine is free from CGT and IHT unless you are classified as a trader.

[20/02/2025, 11:47:48] ~ Dipesh Patel: I use AI tools to help collate info and do some easy research. It's very impressive in terms of speed and breadth but still hit and miss so you have to get into the weeds still. Deepseek and Perplexity better. You then still have to make your own judgement on when you read 'losing share and AI supremacy' .. what does that mean really and how much and what is priced in or not in a stock... that will take some time for AI tools to get right. Analysts and 'brains' still need to do that bit for the moment.
[20/02/2025, 12:00:02] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Baidu - generally perceived as a poorly run company - burns through the cash it generates without showing enough growth for it. Themes and products all good but need to see shareholders benefiting somehow. Ludicrously cheap but that's how it works. Used to own some (ouch), would like to get back at some point.
[20/02/2025, 12:05:51] ~ Dipesh Patel: I've started buying. Am finding it very cheap v the pack but don't disagree with yours/others comments. For me it's part of a rotational trade into China. I'm a huge fan of Tepper and own Alibaba, KWEB, JD, Tencent and TAL. If China does see some proper domestic recovery the search business revs mentioned above will turn positive. Like all tech/AI plays the monetisation is now in question...Baidu already has that priced in unlike US counterparts 🤷🏽‍♂️.

The Majorana 1’s significance hinges on execution. If it’s as foundational as Microsoft claims, it’s a top-tier milestone—like the shift from abacus to calculator or sail to steam. It could compress decades of progress into years, reshaping society faster than most innovations in history. For now, it’s a spark with the potential to ignite a new era—how bright it burns depends on what comes next.

[21/02/2025, 13:15:17] Nick finegold: Roche Reveals First Details of Its Nanopore-Based NGS Platform

Why it matters:

Roche has finally provided concrete details on its nanopore-based next-gen sequencing (NGS) platform, a move that could shake up the sequencing market. 

While it won’t commercially launch until 2026, the new platform could pose a challenge to Oxford NanoporeTechnologies (ONT)—though ONT still holds key advantages in long-read sequencing.

The big picture:

Roche’s platform integrates:
	•	SBX chemistry from Stratos Genomics (acquired in 2020).
	•	Hardware from Genia (acquired in 2014).

Unlike ONT, Roche’s system lacks long-read sequencing capabilities—a critical feature that has set ONT apart. However, Roche’s use of nanopore technology could still impact sentiment toward ONT in the short term.

Between the lines:
	•	Roche’s system delivers Q20+ sequencing at >1,000 bp read lengths (simplex mode)—slightly longer than Illumina but far from ONT’s ultra-long reads.
	•	A duplex mode claims Q39 base accuracy with >99.3% raw read accuracy, making it a highly competitive offering.
	•	Real-time base calling and near-real-time mapping/alignment bring the system closer to ONT’s flexibility.
	•	Reusability: Roche hints at a “cost-effective” reusable sensor, though pricing remains unknown.
	•	Future potential: The company suggests direct epigenetic modification detection could be integrated later, aligning with ONT’s roadmap.

The bottom line:

For now, ONT retains its long-read advantage, reinforcing its niche. Roche’s approach signals that short-read sequencing still dominates the market, and the company has yet to develop a long-read chemistry to compete directly with ONT.

What’s next:
	•	2024: Roche expands its early access program.
	•	2026: Initial research-use-only launch of the SBX platform.
	•	Clinical version to follow.
	•	Pricing remains a wild card—if Roche undercuts ONT and gets closer to Illumina’s pricing, the competition could intensify.


I will speak to the company but my best guess is that having Roche breathing down their neck forces Nanopore into the arms of someone much much bigger .

In another way it’s a validation of the magnitude of the opportunity but clearly the market has little interest in taking that view . 

Not launched this year , and ONT still clearly technologically superior , but at least it explains the recent price movement .
[21/02/2025, 13:19:06] Nick finegold: I think the disruptive part of this could be that roches system has a reusable slide. Where as Nanopore is more like a razor blade you throw away and buy another . 

Will be back .

A few concerns on Naopore understandably . The key to integrity is always being visible when things don’t go the right way .

News out from illumina  in the sequencing space as well as Roche which I am not quite sure what to make of , as always we will go away and do the work and return but for now , Nanopore has a pile of cash and raft of potential bidders and neither illumina nor Roche are at market for another year so we will hang tight until Nanopire reports which I think is next week . 

I think I the market concerns are more scary than any individual price movement. 

What’s crystal clear is that Trump = Uncertainty and that uncertainty is bad for corporate earnings  everywhere. I think that is the simple conclusion that people have arrived at. 

Throw in a gold canary in the coal mine and Buffet buying no shares back and it feels like the trump trade is starting to face up to the reality , which is that  no management real around the world has a clue where they stand.

[26/02/2025, 14:32:05] ~ LZ: Hello my friends, 

If you have a spare 5 minutes, the Adam Smith Institute is running an anonymous Business Survey, looking at attitudes towards the UK’s business and investment landscape. 

They’re keen to give a voice to private sector frustration with the state of things, so if you could fill this out and pass it onto any other business leaders or owners you know I’d be very grateful.

They’re also looking for business leaders who would be happy to give an on the record quote- if you are, I’ll pass you onto the ASI’s comms director.

[26/02/2025, 16:04:06] ~ Jonny Haycock: Asking anyone to listen to an interview 1.5 hrs long is something one should rarely do. But, Tucker interviewing Luke Gromen about what’s going on in gold mkts right now and why so much gold is continuing to flow to the US is absolutely fascinating. Beyond the mainstream headlines of tariffs, we genuinely might be seeing the opening phase of gold becoming a neutral reserve asset again and all part of Trump/Vance’s /Bessent’s vision of making America great again post the failure of the $ reserve system to benefit most Americans apart from Wall St for the last 50yrs. It’s only one man’s view and could be wrong, but it’s well articulated and would be seismic for the financial system as we know it. I will try to ask Farage about this next week.

[27/02/2025, 08:33:45] ~ William Nutting: 2 things from yday maybe of note to above and to NVIDIA naaahhh reaction.

1. On PALANTIR vs SMCI: We own neither right now, but SMCI is tempting, as an “AI enabler”, high beta and has
had masses of retail attention but its just SO cheap! Its on 2x sales with 65% revenue growth, bottom line has
been chopping around but its also pretty attractive, 19x forward for 65% revenue growth, try and find a
company trading on those metrics, btw. PLTR is still on 80x sales and 161x forward with 28% revenue growth! (Tx
PB).

2. TESLA: I clearly have an alternative view but not blind to the pain here. If Tesla was only a car company
(emphatically it is NOT!) and if it was no longer a growth story ( in cars seems it isnt!) and could no longer deliver above average margins, you could legitimately ask why it should trade at a such a high premium valuation?
If Tesla were to re-rate to trade to a 15x P/E ratio, ( 2x TOYOTA’s 7.05x and three times VOLKSWAGEN’s 4.19x ) TESLA
Shares would be trading at $33. 
That would be a 90 % decline from current level…
[27/02/2025, 08:38:19] ~ Julie: LSEG pre-tax profit £1.26b lower than expected $1.53b but inline or small beat on all other numbers. Further £500m buy-back. https://www.lseg.com/en/investor-relations/financial-results/2024-preliminary-results#highlights
[27/02/2025, 08:41:11] ~ Dipesh Patel: I own it. The nasdaq filing looked fine to be and interesting no restatement of any kind. I don't share the positive views on Hindenberg as an aside, but they did improve a lot of the things SMCI needed to get right. It'll be cleaner going fwd and is very cheap. The issue is margins...shockingly no margin rocket here unlike Nvidia managed despite multiples of revenue. It's been poorly run in my view but now has money and a lot of dirt behind it. They need to prove they can grow profits and cashflow as their top line multiplies
[27/02/2025, 08:46:02] ~ JB: Rolls has an engine plant in Indianapolis mainly for the US airforce.
[27/02/2025, 08:55:00] ~ Julie: MAN Group have also reported  - better than expected,  announced £100m buyback. ‎<This message was edited>

[27/02/2025, 10:34:10] ~ JB: Exor selling 4% of their Ferrari stake or $3.2bn. 
Takes them down to 20.4% total holding.

EXOR on 17.7x PE
[27/02/2025, 10:35:20] ~ Dipesh Patel: It quite simple I think. RR either takes a pricing/margin hit to accommodate the tariffs and stays neutrally competitive or buyers in the US conclude RR is  still cheaper because of where the USD/GBP rate is on a multi year view. They'd only need to shift if RR was incredibly expensive v GE. I have no idea re relative pricing but suspect RR has had a USD/GBP advantage
[27/02/2025, 10:35:57] ~ Jim: And quite possible no tarrifs  on uk 🇬🇧
[27/02/2025, 10:38:15] ~ Mark Wharrier: The commercial engines are made almost entirely in Derby and Singapore. It’s complicated by the fact that the engines are all sold on LT service agreements so initial engine price a low proportion. Tariffs in 1930s easy, today a bit more complex!
[27/02/2025, 13:00:51] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Switching engine supplier is not a straightforward process. Both technical and regulatory challenges. Plus, for such decisions, these companies take a much longer view than four years. You heard it from Alcoa yesterday.
[27/02/2025, 13:04:11] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Plus there are currently supply chain issues. I would guess that at the margin someone like Boeing becomes less competitive in their exports - as if they didn't have other headaches. But they've started the year well because demand for aircraft remains strong.
[27/02/2025, 13:18:00] ~ Zac Bobolakis: The problem with RR is that it's now quite an expensive stock.
[27/02/2025, 14:39:42] ~ Ben Finegold: Another important milestone for geothermal. Private company but Quaise will be a winner in this space.

Many of you would have found policy bazaar hard to buy and therefore missed last years 170% rise . 

It’s now pulled back a long way and offers us another entry point . 

If you can’t be arsed to work out how to buy Indian shares then Chikara’s Indian fund has a chunk of PB and has outperformed the sell off by 12% relative and I will happily put you in touch . I think India is a generational opportunity just like China was 20 years ago.

[28/02/2025, 11:19:15] ~ Dipesh Patel: You can't. Love the club but have always felt PB is a stretch as you can't buy it!
[28/02/2025, 11:32:21] Nick finegold: It’s not simple but you can buy them if you set up with interactive brokers and Saxo bank according to ChatGPT . 

As a UK citizen, buying Indian stocks involves a few steps due to local regulations and foreign investment restrictions. Here’s how you can invest in Indian equities from the UK:

1. Investing via Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Route (For Institutional or HNW Investors)
	•	The FPI route allows foreign investors to trade Indian stocks directly on the NSE (National Stock Exchange) or BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange).
	•	However, this requires registration with SEBI (India’s financial regulator), which is typically for institutions or high-net-worth individuals.
	•	You must go through an SEBI-registered custodian or a Participatory Notes (P-Notes) issuer.

Not ideal for retail investors.

2. Investing via an International Broker with Indian Market Access

Some international brokers allow direct investment in Indian stocks. These include:
	•	Interactive Brokers – Offers access to the NSE and BSE.
	•	Saxo Bank – Allows investment in select Indian companies.
	•	Winvesta – Provides fractional investing in some Indian stocks via ADRs (American Depository Receipts).

💡 Action: Check with these platforms if they support direct investments in Indian equities.

3. Investing via Indian Mutual Funds & ETFs (Easiest Way)
	•	UK brokers like Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell, or Interactive Brokers offer access to Indian mutual funds and ETFs.
	•	Popular India-focused ETFs include:
	•	iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA)
	•	Lyxor MSCI India ETF
	•	WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (EPI)

💡 Pros: Simple, cost-effective, no need for an Indian trading account.

4. Investing via ADRs & GDRs (Indirect Exposure)
	•	Some Indian companies list ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) on U.S. exchanges or GDRs (Global Depositary Receipts) in Europe.
	•	Examples include:
	•	Infosys (INFY)
	•	HDFC Bank (HDB)
	•	Tata Motors (TTM)

💡 Trade these via UK brokers that offer U.S. or European stock access.

5. Opening an Indian Trading & Demat Account (For Direct Investing)

If you want full access to Indian stocks, you must:
	1.	Open an NRE/NRO Bank Account (for repatriable/non-repatriable investments).
	2.	Register for a PIS (Portfolio Investment Scheme) Account via an Indian bank (ICICI, HDFC, SBI).
	3.	Open a Demat & Trading Account with an Indian broker (Zerodha, ICICI Direct, Kotak Securities).
	4.	Convert GBP to INR and fund the account.

💡 Most complex route but allows direct stock ownership.

Final Thoughts – What’s the Best Route?

✅ Easiest: Buy India ETFs/mutual funds via UK brokers.
✅ Best for stock picking: Use Interactive Brokers or look at ADRs/GDRs.
✅ For direct Indian stock trading: Open an NRE/NRO account + Demat account with an Indian broker.
[28/02/2025, 11:48:57] ~ Matt H: What’s the tariff situation with the US and India?
[28/02/2025, 11:56:11] ~ Andrew Draycott: It’s been postponed pending increased military spending and repatriation on Indian citizens. India historically has bought soviet military hardware as the states sold fighters to Pakistan. They bought French recently,but now are indicating they will buy US. It’s hard situation because 50% of installed military hardware is Russian. But also worth noting india is <1% of global manufacturing whilst China is >25% so dumping is hard to allege. They are looking to lower tariffs in high end cars (concession to musk? Where previously they insisted that companies manufacture on shore to evade). The area that could be hit is services (they are 8% of services exports globally) and that could hurt IT services like infosys and Tata Consultancy

Although there was some controversy around the New York pilot for Evlv , if one wants to paint a blue sky scenario for Evolv it would be adoption in all areas of mass transportation in America it’s subways and beyond. 

We have done a poor job historically of catching your attention but we expect Evlv to have a good year almost regardless of market conditions as fighting gun and knife crime is a very high priority for most and the shares have already been hit hard , so it’s a good entry point for one of our core buys .

[02/03/2025, 18:13:05] ~ Jim: There is no money for a strategic reserve. The us market is on the way down
[02/03/2025, 18:14:52] Nick finegold: I guess that’s another way of saying . It’s a risk on asset and it’s a risk off market for sure Jim . I suppose it depends on the incentives that encourage ownership .
[02/03/2025, 18:15:35] ~ Jim: This move up is a manipulation.

[02/03/2025, 20:07:27] Nick finegold: FYI we have Nigel Farage tommorow night and Raoul Pal has agreed to address us in person in June when the US Crypto commission reports , or shortly after . Then we may have a shot at Kemi as well which is being worked on . 

We are upping our game on our guest speakers . ‎<This message was edited>

[03/03/2025, 05:35:46] ~ Jim: kemi you should go through dominic johnson
[03/03/2025, 05:58:05] ~ William Nutting: I think Kemi should be biting your arm off to have a chance to address such a pre-eminent group….
[03/03/2025, 10:34:08] Nick finegold: Coinbase has had a brutal pull back and I am long in alpha capture . It’s showing + 8% in the pre market . it’s the plumbing for a lot of other crypto businesses and I wonder if it is a safer way to play the aspiration to make the US the crypto capital of the world , regardless of where prices  go or if it will be somewhat disintermediated by ETF’s . 

I would welcome any thoughts
[03/03/2025, 10:44:18] ~ Matthew Cyzer: All I’d say is that thru Cowen back in the day we knew Coinbase mgmt extremely well and as we were building out our crypto business (subsequently sold on TD’s insistence when they bought us) had an opportunity to invest very early and I am still long. I recall their management being far and away the most realistic and capable business people we met in the space (we did a bit of a beauty parade) hence we chose to partner up with them. This was over three years ago and the relationship is no longer current, but in case that’s of any help (probably not!)
[03/03/2025, 10:48:09] Nick finegold: Many thanks Matt
[03/03/2025, 10:52:31] Nick finegold: I hope to see lots of tonight at Sir Paul Marshall’s club UnHerd , where we can interview Nigel Farage ourselves without having to tolerate Laura Kuenssberg x
[03/03/2025, 10:55:44] Nick finegold: Kick off 6pm-6.30pm 2-4 Old Queen St Westminster . Finishes at 9pm
[03/03/2025, 11:03:38] ~ Jim: Developing rare earth projects in Ukraine in the foreseeable future is complete "fiction," with hurdles ranging from uncertainty over reserves to a lack of processing capacity outside of China, industry veterans say, with one expert describing U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to recoup war aid by exploiting the partially occupied country's natural resources as "absurd”…..

Experts are very skeptical, particularly about rare earth elements (REE), with doubts that Ukraine even has viable deposits to mine, as claims of reserves are based on exploration done during the Soviet era.

"There are no known rare earth deposits in the Ukraine, period," said John Mavrogenes, a professor of economic geology at the Australian National University, calling the claim "fiction" and the proposal "absurd."

"I assume that these people talking about it don't know the difference between a rare earth and any other critical mineral," he added. (Source: asia.nikkei.com)
[03/03/2025, 11:05:02] ~ Matt H: I have had a look at the Ukrainian assets. They won’t make money.

[03/03/2025, 12:32:28] ~ Zac Bobolakis: When the first story of a deal was talked about, I recall seeing a map implying that the majority of mineral wealth is in the areas occupied by Russia. I have no knowledge or opinion on this.
[03/03/2025, 12:33:21] ~ William Nutting: DIGITAL ASSETS: a few asking what we are doing. Well own BTC ETHE VIRTUALS & Helium etc. On COINBASE  I am buying Jan 26 calls. Other good proxies for more institutional crypto adoption are GLXY and HOOD. I use a combination of the 3 to try to avoid some of the stock specific risk.
And in a momentum tape I’d be adding SUI & DOGE.

[03/03/2025, 13:35:58] ~ Simon Brewer: Have enough people asked the question prompted by some work i was looking at yesterday ; " _have the so-called economic value of these deposits been assessed? In light of the usual inclination of the big mining companies to operate anywhere there are lucrative deposits to be exploited, including the highest-risk countries, the fact that Ukraine has attracted minimal interest from large mining companies up until now suggests that this country’s deposits generally are not lucrative_".... Might it not be like Greenland that we have taken as gospel that there is stuff the West wants there? .Sir Mick Davis former CEO of Xstrata dismisses Greenland in this week's podcast...and the big investment opportunity is in the big miners. Restored balance sheets, big dividends, out of favour....patience will be needed but i know where i'm allocating this year...
[03/03/2025, 13:39:13] ~ Richard Windsor: Burford Capital... this extract from the Q4 press release explains the share price move.... surprised this made it into the release to be honest... rather amusing:
"Our accounting numbers move around based on interest rates,
changes in duration and the achievement of litigation milestones, but cash is what we watch and use as the basis to pay
our people. So when we see periods like the fourth quarter of 2024, which showed an accounting loss in the face of
$253 million in realizations, including a $106 million settlement on December 31 against a $36 million deployment, we
shrug our shoulders and go back to counting the cash."

[04/03/2025, 14:29:23] ~ GR: The recent Nasdaq 📉 from its Feb 19 high to todays low -10% is the 3 fastest -10% drop in history (other than 1 day crashes) 

1. COVID 2020 March (6 days) 
2. GFC 2008  October (8 days)

4. Tech 2000 April  (13 days)
[04/03/2025, 15:56:42] Nick finegold: So far it feels the Dow has held up well as investors understandably flocked to safety and Blue chips . 

The companies that have done the most brilliant job on a global basis , have clearly been the huge blue chips globally names . Macdonalds , Tesla , Starbucks. Nike , Apple , Coke Boeing . 

I am just listening to CNN and wondering if there are any signs of consumer boycotts or what CNN calls anti Americanism , but a phrase I have heard regularly on the news in a financial context .

[05/03/2025, 09:44:55] Nick finegold: It’s inconceivable to me that OSI Systems is not a beneficiary of the call by Trump for more funds for better border control last night. 

The Canadians have also earmarked $900m . 

OSI Systems is a world leader in cargo screening and border control , as it looks for narcotics people and weapons . 

Their corporate video is currently shockingly bad .

Both mentioned by NF a few months back
[05/03/2025, 11:01:29] Nick finegold: Yup arcelor on our watch list for this reason . Infrastructure spending is an ai antidote for the time being .
[05/03/2025, 11:02:07] ~ Jim: VW to make defence kit?
[05/03/2025, 11:02:48] ~ William Nutting: ARCELOR BASF WIZZ RWE VEON US and VW maybe prob better at making Tanks than FIAT!
[05/03/2025, 11:03:10] ~ William Nutting: Well put!
[05/03/2025, 11:07:43] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Poilievre was v quick to take the same stance a few weeks ago when this started. Important to remember that given Canada's size rel to the US the impact of any negative measures will very felt more. But the Ontario response to tax electricity exports a smart move because it's not a discretionary spend by the US. But all in all this is not a zero sum game so will hurt everyone.
[05/03/2025, 11:10:55] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Not an attractive thought based on historic precedent. But reminder that European deindustrialisation is vastly overstated. It's just not allocated in what is now needed.
[05/03/2025, 11:27:53] ~ David Haysey: Haven’t owned VW this century and it’s a horrible industry but there is an active restructuring story in China and German ops and is on <3x consensus 2026 fwiw. Expectation is for divi cut in respect of 2024 but still would yield c6%. Not up to speed but will dig on this as intrigued.

[05/03/2025, 12:39:27] ~ William Nutting: NF. Think the point on europe here is key!

Love him / it or hate him/it Trump and his team seem to get the message that the World has changed after 30yrs of pretty much the same. Brutal common sense is tough for many to stomach after so much “B*s” and most in the West simply arent there yet. 
In the same way so much Portfolio Management is passive intransigent and downright lazy, and that has been the case for 30yrs ( alot of my career) Indexation has worked incredibly well. The average yearly return of the S&P 500 is 10.98% over the last 30 years, 8.6% Inflation adjusted (to December 2024).
In that time 71% active funds have failed to beat the index. Might amaze you that all those smart Private Equity peoples 20yr returns are still <S&P annualised. 

It is for this and many reasons amongst others that right now Markets “fascinate and humble” NUTSTUFF in equal measure.

IMHO I still think Real Alpha now is going to be made buying UNloved and perceived UNinvestable Markets & Stocks & Sectors and waiting for the catalyst when the  wall of passive flows and momentum chasing machines turn up.  

A TIP: Look at 5yr + charts NOT 12mth ones.
 
Think MASLOW: think NEEDS vs WANTS: Think simplistically cutting through all the cr@p of bear markets and sell-offs etc Which Stocks are close to or at all time Highs today: 
Its not that complicated: its waste removal; its chicken, defence and “never leave home without one”…

CHINA, Nutstuff owns stocks here absolutely and first buying a year ago when I was there for the 1st time. ********

EUROPE: Remember a key Factoid: for all the love affair still out there with buying Mag7 and its related Ai food chain ( Largely still WANTS vs NEEDS) since the Ukraine debacle, for every $100 that came out of the Market in ‘22 STILL only $3 came back so far. ( tx Shrub) 
I see 5 Names all Buyable today.ame way so muc
THERE IS HOWEVER AN EVEN BIGGER MORE DISLIKED OUTLIER! and this is also where Nutstuff has big focus…..
[05/03/2025, 13:00:09] ~ GR: Which one ?
[05/03/2025, 13:04:11] ~ Robin Maxwell: Started buying VW (just a toe) about 2 months back. Up through 50 day MA on ca 13th Dec post a 70% drawdown since 2021 highs. I am expecting them to omit dividend. But I also expect that in 20 years they will still be one of the three largest mobility companies on the planet. After 30 years following DACH equity I am used to the idea that the Germans do ultimately get their sh*t together when they need to. Maybe the Merz election is also part of that. 🤞
[05/03/2025, 14:23:48] ~ Robin Maxwell: For EssilorLuxottica watchers … note Fielmann AG (I am invested/ teach-in to club in Feb’24) numbers out yesterday with stock +15% at one point. Impressive growth rates in depressed economies. Margins up as guided. 2025 Group adjusted Ebitda confirmed at 24%. My long term thesis is simple - there is room in a world of rapidly deteriorating eyesight for 2x EssilorL. Fielmann’s recent US entry suggests such an ambition.
[05/03/2025, 16:17:57] Nick finegold: There is hope, Finers…

 “The reality is that I still don't think the enormity of the news has got close to being fully comprehended and digested by global investors yet. This is a seismic shift of the most epic proportions from Germany and perhaps only fast money and nimble investors have responded so far. However, over the days, weeks and months to come, investment committees and asset allocators will slowly and surely have to adjust their thoughts and positioning on what is the 3rd largest economy in the world, especially after five years of essentially zero growth.”

[06/03/2025, 20:40:34] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Overbought short term but demand is v strong. The problem is supply chains as Melrose said this morning. Companies have big backlogs (a lot of it from outside Europe) even without this week's events. So there is further upstream capex coming. America's reshoring (with tariffs or without) means shakeup of its supply chains but inevitably means change of supply chains globally. The third supply chain shock in five years.

[07/03/2025, 06:35:44] ~ JB: OKLO buys Atomic Alchemy for $25m.  

AA’s VIPR technology is about recovery of useful material from stockpiled nuclear waste. ASPI’s technology has much broader applications. 

The purchase price of $25m indicates AA is still at the development stage of application.

It does show OKLO’s desire to get into medical isotopes.  OKLO’s view the medical isotope market is undersupplied and growing to over $56bn is something ASPI mgmt would agree with.
[07/03/2025, 08:48:13] ~ Andrew Draycott: 2bn USD convertible just announced for a company with $40bn of cash. This is why I don’t understand China. Bye raised $5bn this week yet have $7bn net cash already. Why do these companies dilute?

DRC as
You all know has large Lithium Cobalt and Uranium deposits.

[09/03/2025, 07:17:07] Nick finegold: This also caught my eye, structural demand for metals is high and the willingness to find find new deposits low.
[09/03/2025, 07:18:55] Nick finegold: Somewhat underpins one’s belief in a commodity super cycle.  The article explains 40% of money spent looking for new deposits was gold , which ain’t much use in transition ! A lot of the remainder was Copper which clearly is helpful .

[09/03/2025, 08:31:49] ~ David Haysey: Yes. Panama needs this mine as you can see it’s a big deal for their economy but it’s very unpopular locally so a difficult path to thread; I think if First Q was American this would have been priced for solution
[09/03/2025, 08:43:37] ~ Matt H: The more interesting thing for short term copper prices is how near the M23 rebels from the copper supply routes out of the DRC which is not far. Will Felix do a deal with the US or someone else before the rebels disrupt the routes. Will Felix last as president? 
While I like copper like everyone else it always seems like the supposed super cycle for copper is a few years away with various excuses over the years. Recently the excuse has been the decline in the Chinese housing sector. 
If Cobre Panama comes back online it will add circa 1.5% of supply to the copper market.

Carney decried what he said were Trump’s efforts to bully Canada into giving up key natural resources including oil, gas, coal, potash and uranium: “The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,” he said, adding, “In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.”

[11/03/2025, 08:52:03] Nick finegold: The WGC’s response to gold being pulled from the Bank of England . Thanks Claire. 

The curated summary : it’s temporary , gold hasn’t been targeted by tarrifs and the market can cope .

More simply, I think that in the current macro environment, (with a weaker $ , an unpredictable stock market and interest rates likely to fall)  , global asset allocators who have been underweight for years must be starting to think about upping their weightings, in spite of  Golds great performance. 

Beneath surface complexity lies a deep simplicity .

[14/03/2025, 15:14:22] ~ William Nutting: A TALE OF 2 OXFORDS. (. Repeat of this from a few mths back)…
( I defer to Nick F & Curation on OXFORD NANOPORE ONT LN a  “Buy it before someone else does” story…) 

On OXFORD BIOMEDICA / OXB LN this is much less well known than OXFORD NANOPORE and is still 1/3rd size so much smaller and it trades on 1.3 X sales for 35% growth. 
OXB is the world leader in making “Lentivector technology” and has never lost a customer - ever. Simply put, a type of vector (delivery mechanism) for the largest payloads in cell and gene therapy and the fastest growing type of vector in the world right now . This is essential for treating many types of cancer and single gene defect diseases such as Sickle cell disease and Cystic Fibrosis.
There are companies in this space trading at 5X with zero growth. 
OXB is just transitioning to profitability and they should make a small profit this year but a significant one next and then accelerate going forward. The restructuring of the business is also saving an est £30 million a year from the bottom line! 
OXB LN is currently @2X sales growing at 35% CAGR. I think should be at 5-7X which is where CDMO co’s trade which equals a share price of £7.50 vs £2.88 today. 
Many may ask why so weak recently, well there has been a key huge seller that came about from a large Asset Management M&A and consequential funds restructuring. Thats now seemingly passed!

[15/03/2025, 10:23:47] ~ Chris Huggins: This is almost certain to end in tears. Buy the senior CBs and short the stock. 

Saylor’s Strategy: buy higher, pump harder  https://on.ft.com/3XTqC9D
[15/03/2025, 10:25:32] Nick finegold: How and where can buy the convertible ?
[15/03/2025, 10:27:25] ~ Chris Huggins: I (occasionally) trade CBs via UBS Wealth. Not got the trade on yet, but will do some more digging
[15/03/2025, 10:29:39] Nick finegold: So Micro strategy has an atm or shelf just constantly selling convert stock at market.
[15/03/2025, 10:33:42] ~ William Nutting: Yup. Just remember MSTR had $500M dollars in cash. Today, even at these prices, MSTR has $39BN dollars of Bitcoin and $7BNof debt. Net, they have at least $29BN of hard value on top of their software business. Bitcoin has gone up 7x. MSTR’s book value has gone up 60x.
[15/03/2025, 10:34:10] ~ Chris Huggins: As some stage he will have to sell XBT to fund a redemption or the CBs or to meet the 8pct coupon of the pref…..he could pay that it stock but at the stage MSTR will be at a huge discount to NAV….that will likely be an existential moment.
[15/03/2025, 10:35:40] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Key to all this is that MSTR equity currently trades at >3x NAV.
[15/03/2025, 10:36:38] ~ Zac Bobolakis: So Saylor needs to keep running to stay still.
[15/03/2025, 10:36:48] ~ Dipesh Patel: Would be very careful to read the terminology and various disclaimers on this one more than any other!! Not sure how senior one might end of feeling. He might just not pay the coupon or not be able to 🤷🏽‍♂️
[15/03/2025, 10:38:49] ~ Chris Huggins: MSTR have executed a textbook ponzi in plain sight. 

This is not a comment on XBT, it’s been a colossal failure of regulation to allow US retail to pump the equity to 3x NAV …. Requiring every greater amounts or leverage, financial engineering and hope to keep it there. 

There will be tears
[15/03/2025, 10:38:57] Nick finegold: So at some stage this crashed BTC ? If he becomes a forced seller to meet redemptions ? 

His view is to lock them up and never sell them , cornering the market.
[15/03/2025, 10:39:14] Nick finegold: That’s trumps view as well .

[15/03/2025, 11:49:38] ~ Rich McDonald: Just to play devils advocate -

At what price BTC (or equally, how much does fiat need to collapse) before he starts to look like a visionary?
E.g. At 250k Bitcoin by Dec 2026, do we think it’s better to have owned BTC outright, or to have owned MSTR?
Is it much different to highly levered Property companies deflating their debt through asset inflation?
(Note: I definitely don’t own MSTR and would love to see all ponzi’s collapse!)
[15/03/2025, 12:35:47] Nick finegold: Very good interview with Musk . It’s important we listen to all sides and he is very good in this .

[15/03/2025, 12:42:21] Nick finegold: It ain’t that different to shutting down NHS England
[15/03/2025, 14:17:34] ~ William Nutting: On BTC/ MSTR if its still having to deal with the grumpy old man mantra of “ponzi on ponzi” or “greater fools theory” then I don’t think this group is going to be able to handle the intricacies of working through the reality of an energy backed range coin that has the potential to demonetise Bitcoin on ethereum! If Bitcoin is a thing then honestly MSTR is Berkshire Hathaway! 
I’d also add that most people also largely misunderstand the bond trade side of things and the lack of a call on the debt. 
Bon weekend .

[15/03/2025, 14:25:11] ~ Dipesh Patel: You did make me laugh at the Berkshire comparison. If anything WB is about, he's about not leveraging or having complex capital structures to his investments.

[15/03/2025, 14:42:02] ~ Rachid: A good friend and former colleague who knows about CB’s and derivatives did  this podcast recently whereby he  gave his perspective of MSTR strategy. Very interesting. Enjoy!!
[15/03/2025, 14:45:46] ~ David Haysey: You don’t need to be a BTC sceptic to be a MSTR sceptic. BTC is easy to buy and leverage easy to get if you’ve any kind of credit rating. So why pay a premium for a barrel of leveraged BTC with a grifter sitting on it?
[15/03/2025, 15:06:50] ~ Zac Bobolakis: I think this is the point. Without making personal judgement of Saylor or Musk, compare MSTR with TSLA, on which I have said before is very expensive and unshortable. That's because it has the EM optionality in it. You short it, EM comes up with a new venture, you get stopped. Being "right" has nothing to do with it. MSTR is nothing like that, it's just an XBT shell trading way too expensive. The software business is irrelevant and not even Saylor cares about it. There is no optionality in MSTR. Saylor may be right in his XBT view but the only visionary bit compared to any dedicated XBT investor/hodler is selling overvalued stock to buy more. If you are a believer, buy XBT or an ETF. MSTR has nothing to offer on top of these apart of the risk of the shrinking premium.

[18/03/2025, 12:43:20] Nick finegold: What I can’t figure out is it’s so obvious that a camera can’t see in the fog there must be something I am missing . After all the bloke built a space ship and relanded it on earth . Surely he knows a camera can’t see in fog .
[18/03/2025, 12:44:03] ~ William Nutting: I think its a decent guess Elon has this …..
[18/03/2025, 12:45:19] Nick finegold: You would think so , but the cars don’t have lidars .

[19/03/2025, 06:57:36] ~ Chris Dale: Nick has kindly invited me to join the club. For those that don’t know me I run a low net Pan-European equity fund with just under $2bn of assets and have run my firm Kintbury Capital for 10 years and prior to that spent 10 years at Millennium. One of the key themes of the last few years has been European defence and we have been long of Rheinmetal (RHM GY) since Nov 2023 which has been amazing (better than Nvidia!). The story has progressed hugely since then and we are still positive. For those wanting to play the theme but think they have missed it, I would recommend looking at Indra (IDR SM) which was an IT services business but is transforming into the national defence champion in Spain. Spain spend almost the lowest as a % of GDP within NATO at 1.5% going to 2.5% by 2029 if approved by parliament. There are a number of disposals/acqs/JV’s in the pipeline that add to complexity but with the shares only on 15x 2025 PE well worth a look and is one of our largest long positions.   The other sector I would mention is EU banks which are incredibly attractive even though they have performed well (better than the Mag7 since 2022). I am at the MS banks conference this week but would suggest that BAWAG (BG AV) is probably the best run bank in Europe (highest returns and lowest cost/income on the sector ) run by an ex PE (Cerberus) CEO who is creating a lot of value buying poorly run spec finance businesses or banks within the DACH region. I’ll leave it there but though I would try to add something now I have signed up!
[19/03/2025, 07:38:03] ~ Robin Maxwell: Chris - thanks for this - good to see you and I have some DACH region interest in common… the club needs more European related input going forward. It’s been a while since anyone mentioned BAWAG to me … will revisit that.
[19/03/2025, 07:39:16] ~ Simon Brewer: For anyone interested- Chris was a guest on the Money Maze Curated Channel-well worth listening to.    ( and I have been an investor since inception)
[19/03/2025, 07:41:37] ~ Ant: (also an investor)
[19/03/2025, 07:43:02] Nick finegold: Anyone interested in Chris’s fund please feel free to contact me off line .
[19/03/2025, 07:47:43] ~ Jonny Haycock: Fwiw, I can also say that not only is Chris, in my view, one of the best idiosyncratic stock pickers in Europe, he’s also a superb golfer and, most importantly, a gentleman.
[19/03/2025, 07:49:43] ~ Robin Maxwell: My portfolio feeling naked without a building materials play after yesterdays German vote. Noting that Heidelberg has already done v well recently and significantly outperformed Holcim and CRH. I havn't looked at these stocks for a while but Holcim being recommended in another investment group I am a member of for Ukraine re-build. Would appreciate any other intel.

[19/03/2025, 08:10:29] ~ Ant: they are reducing hiring of grads / associates though (in WM), the advisers productivity gains from their in house AI engines are HUGE
[19/03/2025, 08:10:53] ~ Ant: (i was at JPM for 20yrs and my wife is still there... you'd be amazed at how impressive their in house AI is now)

[19/03/2025, 08:12:35] ~ Ant: well quite... but none of their sales guys are writing the pitch emails for a stock or fund anymore... neither are they writing call memos or building presentations... hence fewer youngsters needed
[19/03/2025, 08:13:56] ~ Jonny Haycock: Yup, the world has changed big time. Glory days in the distant past.

[19/03/2025, 08:18:24] ~ Robin Maxwell: **Small cap Europe** - I have started building a position in Viridien SA (VIRI) - global market leader in tech that records, processes and interprets land and marine seismic data. Beneficiary of need to find minerals / oil (drill baby drill) ex China. Many moving parts here - but company at a cash flow watershed … forecasting 100m cash flow pa from 2025 onwards - Moodys just upgraded debt ahead of debt refi now completed. Heavily indebted.. but order backlog grew massively in 4Q last year and name is primed to be re-discovered in 2025. Market cap is in £413m on revenues of £940m …. The EV transfer would be enhanced if they sell one of their three businesses in 2026. An ex client of mine has built a 1.75% position in the company on his own account. Stock threatening to break to upside. (see chart)

We’ll be starting our club call with CEO of Lightbridge Group at 3pm today. 

An interesting time with the current momentum in the nuclear sector. LTBR shares went up +361% in the last year and around +83% YTD which makes it one worth looking into. Ben will kindly run point today.

Register below and look forward to seeing you there!

[19/03/2025, 13:35:55] ~ Simon Brewer: thanks Jonny - I have added to my Silver over the last week - it's a fraction of my gold weights, but it's behaving well and i think over the next 12 months can appreciate a fair amount..
[19/03/2025, 13:39:50] ~ Jonny Haycock: Wise. I think it will explode Simon. At VON GREYERZ, our simple view is that when you start to see silver outperform gold (the gold/silver ratio is unchanged at about 90), then that will be the signal for the next powerful leg of this secular bull mkt in precious metals. inflation adjusted, silver needs to hit $200 to hit 1980 peak.
[19/03/2025, 13:48:30] ~ William Nutting: 2 things: Russia? And Helium/HNT. I like how this is re-inflating! 

Nutstuff said a Week ago to prepare for things to suddenly move very fast. Russian Sanctions to be lifted: looks like that just became reality. “Sanctions against Russia will begin to be lifted after an agreement on a ceasefire in Ukraine” says special envoy Witkoff
I HAVE ASKED THIS BEFORE ALOT: WHAT IF A “UKRAINE CEASE-FIRE & A PATH TO PEACE”;  Well, the higher Octane plays You can own via Turkey. (And yet another buying opportunity in the Turkish market overnight!) 
Think Russias Biggest Brewery: ****(@3x PE)  
Russias largest Shopping Mall: ****
Whirlpool US’s Russian partner for White goods etc etc. ****
In US, I’d also highlight NBIS US (Yandex) in UKRAINE as an oversold AI play. (Zero Hedge all over it today). 

DePIN, HELIUM & BLOCKCHAIN: CATHIE WOOD is latest to “get with the program“ re. Tokenisation and Infrastructure being buildable with TOKENincentives. The focus cant hurt!  BTW. A few have asked, so to be clear you can buy HNT Helium on REVOLUT. A $566m MKT CAP is absurd! ‎<This message was edited>

[20/03/2025, 06:34:40] ~ Matt H: But if you look at the copper price all the big trading houses going long copper as M23 get near Kelembie
[20/03/2025, 06:56:17] ~ Dipesh Patel: If remotely helpful...Apparently there are slight disruptions to supply, but they have not impacted the price of supply as it stands (I'm in the region right now DRC/Rwanda and Uganda). Last night a gold supplier said unrefined gold and copper leaving DRC has not had any issues for him, but there is genuine concern that that is next. Not sure I agree re DRC troops.. not paid enough, yes, but not sure they're doing that job for the direct money! Am long copper, but based on structural demand before the M23 issues. The sense here is there is genuine concern but apparently no major disruption yet. The worrying thing typically is if a particular General sets his eyes on why many do join the army... opportunity.

[20/03/2025, 11:54:57] ~ Stretch: UK food prices will be dropping exponentially, potato picking apple picking carrot picking will all be done by robots. The annual cost per worker currently is around £35,000 and this will be a one off payment for the acquisition of a robot who will work continuously 24 seven does not need to be housed does not need a Visa does not need any national insurance contributions.

Gold will not be revalued.
Crashing energy prices is probably the number 1 ambition.
Nuclear uninvestable short term without government support, which it seems they will provide due to their ambitious energy policies . .
Booze Allen received 98% of Govt consulting fees . Suggested  too much of anything going to a single vendor is not good risk management . ( Palantir ? )
Came across pretty well and balanced to me .

[21/03/2025, 07:10:20] ~ Matt H: It’s about time. I have seen consultants advise mining companies. I don’t think I have ever seen them use common sense. Just reams of useless graphs and market information. Most if not all CEO’s know more about the market.
[21/03/2025, 07:12:16] Nick finegold: It’s the beginning of a white collar blitz which is not going to be pleasant for anyone .

[21/03/2025, 08:01:27] Nick finegold: This is the biggest admission of defeat I have ever read . Bye bye Nanopore and candidly they deserve it . 

Former UK IPO star Nanopore admits it is a takeover target  https://on.ft.com/4iocaPk
[21/03/2025, 08:02:10] Nick finegold: I think there is quite a lot of short interest
[21/03/2025, 08:02:46] ~ William Nutting: And NF; to your thought, the Ellison point is key isnt it – he is much smarter and more knowledgeable than the marginal seller of the shares and he is working in a JV with ONT in infectious disease via the Ellison Institute in Oxford.
[21/03/2025, 08:04:47] Nick finegold: Oracle bought a company called Cerna for $20bn + that stores private medical data in the cloud . 

It would make sense for him to want to get mobile gene sequencing of populations going to help fix broken health services but economically have that data stored in his cloud business
[21/03/2025, 08:05:53] Nick finegold: That’s a vast market that will only happen if gene sequencing becomes an everyday diagnostic tool . That’s what Nanopore should have been talking about .
[21/03/2025, 08:29:37] ~ Matthew Cyzer: Clear Street, the company I work for, has seen enormous growth through patented tech which allows clients all clearing and settlement to occur instantaneously in the cloud, which leads to having a massive data centre of what those clients are doing / have done. Also enormously sticky leading to massive prime balances especially in the 1-5bn client space which is gigantic and utterly ignored by the big boys. Different businesses but to Nick’s point owning enormous cloud based data is a must have for businesses going fwd. As for the white collar exodus, not before time. I have just hired a #1 global rated analyst, seriously the best there is, covering £2trn of mkt cap globally, brings 600 clients with him. He was offered a head of sector job by JP Morgan replacing a legendary retiree within the sector and yet he’ll choose to come to us because with sell side pay on a massive downturn, especially the last couple of years, tech renders these people obsolete in big firms looking desperately to control costs so they have no front end (in anything other than systematic trading) and no post trade tech. The bulge, other than for the obvious, will have to shrink itself significantly going forward. It’s taken me working for what is essentially a tech PE firm to really see how acutely different the approach is. Can extrapolate the same for pretty much any legacy business.

You are all amazing . Coutts have written today and said the money will be reimbursed next week . Several of you went out your way to help and speak to the bank , I even had a friend of a club member help me get the attention of some senior staff. 

In the background . My wife was having surgery this week to save her sight in one eye so I was trying to look after her  . She will not be able to see out of one eye for the next month but then should be ok , it was not a nice week. 

On top of all of that t
we had the Shareflix raise where we now have £1.3m hard and soft commitments  just from the club in a terrible market . 

This club is about so much more than stocks and shares and we are going to work tirelessly to serve our members in all sorts of ways and make this a home for people who want enjoy finance and more importantly want to have fun both in person and on line .

In addition the response to Chris Dales post was one of the most extraordinary things I have seen since I have been running the club and I am hopeful we can raise him 10’s of millions of $ . We shall see . 

All this in just one actioned packed week , who knows what next week will bring  , but what I do know for sure is it will be better with you lot . 

Have a brilliant weekend and thanks again Nick . ‎<This message was edited>

[22/03/2025, 12:15:31] Nick finegold: Gary Paulin in this group writes a wonderful newsletter and talks about this today .
[22/03/2025, 12:16:12] Nick finegold: This is what he wrote but it suggests that commodities will do well and if they do well copper is a big winner . 

Supercycle
 
 	
Now, as you know, commodity prices move in long, sweeping cycles of boom and bust, hence the term ‘supercycles’. The last one, after China entered the WTO, ended in 2012, since when the sector’s suffered from chronic underinvestment, capital constraint, nimbyism and ESG. We now have ‘national security’ trumping ESG and nimbyism. We have rearmament in Europe and Japan, reconstruction hopefully to come in Ukraine, and reshoring in the US. All are commodity-intensive endeavors.

So too is energy transition (the largest construction project on the planet), space activity (the largest outside the planet), AI capex and it seems even China – the largest consumer of commodities – is showing signs of recovery. More about her in a second...
 
 	
Scarcity
 
 	
But my favourite narrative remains that of Scarcity (with a little mean reversion thrown in for measure). You may remember last year we wrote of the mean-reversion potential of the transition from the ‘ethereal’ world (that of ideas/IP) to the material world (things). It was a disaster of a call (for now, mea culpa). Our premise was that scarcity – and therefore value – for technology lies not solely in IP but in the supply chain, the ‘material world’, that underlies it.

As Ed Conway illustrated in his must read, Material World, this ‘world’ is mission-critical to our tech-promised future, perhaps more now than ever. As we said at the time: “...without sand, no silicon. No silicon no glass, no covid vaccines, no iPhone. No silver no solar. No salt, no sanitation, no drinking water. No copper, no electricity”. More pressing today: no titanium, (a coincidence that Ukraine holds a fifth of the world’s reserves?), no F35 fighter jets. No niobium, no missiles, no rockets, no winning the space race.

My question is: what does Trump see (in Ukraine, Greenland, Canada, Panama and DRC) that the market cannot? Answer: rare, yet critical materials. While governments clearly see value and prepared to pursue these rare minerals, I can still find exposures on single digit PEs with huge dividends in regions that are mostly ignored. I suspect Kiril Sokoloff’s observation still holds, that: “...you could buy the top 100 miners, three years of copper production and all seaborne iron-ore with the market cap of Nvidia”.

America’s proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund should take note!
 
 	
China recovering? 
 
 	
As discussed already, don’t fight the command of a command economy. If China wants stocks up, she will probably get her way. It’s often as simple as that. And does she (want stocks up)? Yes. And property prices. Why? Because they represent system collateral. If your end game is to raise domestic consumption, then fixing the housing market will fix collateral, confidence and ultimately consumption. It may unlock the enormous savings potential, estimated to be c40% of GDP (with arguably post-Covid revenge spending still to come in China!).

If this sounds familiar, it was the playbook the US used to recover after the GFC. The most important signal to watch, therefore, is Chinese property data, which has stabilised, as has its market proxy, the SHProp Index. Should this now start to rally, I suspect it will inspire even greater confidence in the broader equity market. And commodities. Why? It’s their biggest market.
 
 	
Should old correlations hold again?
 
 	
Seeing as we are on the topic of mean reversion, a reminder of where things stood for gold (and silver) historically. Yes, gold has made new all-time highs, but should it get back to the market value of US official gold to 1989 levels relative to foreign-held USTs, it would need to at least double again. With regards to silver, the gold-to-silver ratio has averaged about 60x since the 1970s. It’s now at 90x, a historically high. What if old correlations hold? Got gold? Got commodities?

[22/03/2025, 13:11:04] ~ Simon Brewer: Further to this, I would highlight that;  GNX/Gold ratio is still in a multi-year decline and only looking at the chart you would conclude the cyclical decline in commodity prices has not ended.    However there is substantial value in the mining equities and the next commodity bull will be augmented by additional demand for industrial metals and energy needed for re-building of Ukraine/ Datacentres required for AI/ Construction of the Yarlung Tsangpo Hydroelectric Project the world’s largest hydroelectric power plant / Rebuilding of houses, commercial buildings and infrastructure in California.....   so i am buying these big metals listed companies judiciously (As per our podcast with Sir Mick Davis) as economic weakness may well  come first..

[24/03/2025, 21:09:17] ~ William Nutting: Connecting ADOLESCENCE & DEPIN. 
The issues adressed in the Netflix sensation “Adolescence” may be synonymous with the greatest unspoken crisis of our time. 
I am not going to dwell on any reservations I may have had after 4hrs of wrist slittingly depressing viewing and I wanted to point out that a knowledge of the use of turpentine and its paint removing skills could have saved me half an hour of that! 
What however matters much more is that the most dangerous threats to the young no longer arrive in the form of visible enemies or machines of war. They come through screens silent, intimate, ever-present. There is a quiet war being waged on the attention, self-worth, and identity of young people, and society is losing it.
Childhood, once defined by imagination, boredom, and real-world risk, has been replaced by hyper-stimulation and emotional exposure. The treehouses, scraped knees, and slow days have given way to infinite scrolls and dopamine loops. Where connection once meant whispered secrets under a canopy of trees, it now means curated images and performance metrics. Childhood has been digitised—and with it, something essential has been lost.
Institutions meant to nurture young minds have largely turned a blind eye. The education system is preoccupied with optics new facilities, digital showcases, and parent-pleasing upgrades—while the real threat unfolds unchecked. The great handover has happened: children are now raised by algorithms, not adults. Parents, overwhelmed and outnumbered, often surrender early. Devices become pacifiers, lifelines, and unfortunately, gateways.
Bullying, once visible and subject to social correction, is now ambient. It hides in DMs, in group chats, in silence and exclusion. We’ve moved from sticks and stones to likes swipes and shares but the bruises run deeper and the scars are harder to trace. What once stayed in the corridor now follows them home, sleeps beside them, wakes with them. The torment is programmable and worse, it’s now gamified.
But all is not lost. There are glimmers of resistance and one of the most promising comes from an unlikely place and somewhere Nutstuff and George at Sycamore Gap are laser-focussed: decentralised physical infrastructure networks, or DEPIN. These systems reward real-world participation. They are built not on attention extraction, but on contribution. They replace the empty currency of fake likes with real value earned through activity that benefits others, networks maintained, coverage provided, data stored, energy shared.
DEPIN models offer young people something the current system does not: purpose. A sense of building, belonging, and being part of something bigger than themselves. These systems don’t just consume attention they reward action. In a world designed to distract, this is a quiet revolution.
If adolescence today feels like freefall, perhaps the way out is not to retreat but to rebuild. Not to lecture young people but to give them better systems. Systems rooted in contribution, in reality, in resilience. We cannot stop the future from arriving but we can decide what kind of world it builds.

To anyone asking for an investable conclusion of the above, it is to add to or add a position in HELIUM/ HNT. ( you can Buy in REVOLUT). $550m Mkt Cap & 500k going to 1m mobile customers. The data offload to Helium from the Major telco’s is as good an example of how DEPIN works as any. ( There is another soon to launch token which excites even more!)

Connecting Adolescence & DEPIN – A Brief Investment Perspective

After watching the Netflix docuseries Adolescence, it’s clear we’re facing one of the biggest silent crises of our time: the mental and emotional decay of young people. The threat isn’t war or violence—it’s coming through their screens. Social media and digital culture are quietly attacking their attention, identity, and self-worth.

Childhood has been traded for dopamine loops and filtered feeds. Schools and institutions are slow to respond. Parents are overwhelmed. Algorithms are raising our kids now.

But there is hope—and interestingly, it’s coming from the world of decentralised physical infrastructure networks (DEPIN). Unlike the attention-hungry systems kids are trapped in, DEPIN models reward real-world contribution. Instead of chasing likes, users get value for providing services like wireless coverage, data storage, or energy sharing.

This isn’t just tech—it’s a new kind of system that offers young people purpose instead of performance. Something real, something that pays back for participation, not passivity.

The investable takeaway?
Take a position—or add to one—in Helium (HNT). It’s a DEPIN project with a growing user base (500k heading to 1 million mobile users), and big telecoms are already offloading data to its network. Market cap is ~$550M and you can buy it via Revolut.

Bottom line: If today’s systems are failing the next generation, let’s invest in building better ones.

If you have children under 16 i would say it was a mandatory read .  But it doesnt just put the blame on mobile phones . It is just as critical of the ‘safetyism/ helicopter parenting that has been prevalent since 1990….. and the developmental damage that is inflicted by not allowing kids to police themselves in adult free environment’s.

Many dont appreciate that Energy is the best performing S&P subsector YTD. 
In the UK courtesy of daft and misguided NetZero ( I went through the reasons for this on Nutstuff today) and Ed Miliband most small & midcap UK listed energy stocks are the one-legged read headed stepchildren of the Market. 
( almost all their charts similar too, a dead mans heartbeat 💓 suddenly showing life!)
There are no machines here; yet! 
Good to see TULLOW/ Tullow LN today +12-%+ on reports of their asset disposal/ debt repayment plan. 
Also See JERSEY/ JOG LN +8% …
For wider thematic context, from the start of 2025 I have agreed with a few smart contrarian thinkers ( like Thunder said who do fabulous detailed work) that its “the market” that will decide on Net Zero and Energy taxation policy and Eld Miliband ( or his successor) will be forced into a sea change in North Sea oil and gas policy, all the while the US and Europe backtrack on recent kamikaze energy policies. Just THINK about a halving the UK's incentive gas price.
In addition Nutstuff sees DIGITAL ENERGY as a reality: I have seen the possibilities that can come from a new RWA/ Energy backed stablecoin that could unlock the drout of financing available to many of these companies. Think 900bn digital wallets all hunting a yield paying Energy backed Meta Coin. 
A reminder here of The Nutstuff UK Energy basket: a Hotch-botch of extreme risk and Lower risk: JERSEY OIL & Gas, Diversified Energy / DEC LN, 8% yield! AJ Lucas (AJL AU a NW UK Fracking play! ) PANTHEON (wait for US listing in ‘H2’25) HARBOUR/HBR LN, REABOLD, TULLOW, SERICA & KISTOS.

[26/03/2025, 18:53:04] ~ Zac Bobolakis: I think this is skewed by the fact that the London has a larger % of the country's population- France, Spain and many other countries are like that. Assuming London has, say, 17% of the UK's population, a better comparison would be the largest (or, alternatively, the richest) cities up to a cumulative 17% of each country's population.  In the US that would knock out about 50mio, incl at least three of NY,LA,SF,Chicago. The effect would then be more pronounced. Similar for DE, NL.

[28/03/2025, 15:23:28] ~ William Nutting: Does anyone here have a good theory for why we're importing so much gold currently?? Whilst I get that there are tariffs, the US has never been a big gold importer, so it's odd that they’d be taking in this much gold. In fact, there are only a few private players with the balance sheets to buy this much gold, and it's not like GLD has big inflows or anything. A hedge fund would buy futures, they wouldn't want the headache of physical. Could it be a non-economic actor? It all seems odd. I get why tariffs would lead to differentials between different regions, but who wants to risk billions of dollars on inventory of gold, when Trump changes his mind every hour on stuff.
Anyone any good theories?

So if anyone  wanted a pair trade . They are short haul not long , European short haul mainly and have eps baked in on a fleet upgrade .

The holidays business will be c1/3rd of profits guidance is £250m for holidays (but we think will be more) to Sept 25, this is totally capital light and been built from scratch in 3 years and has huge competitive advantage as you are getting existing customers to buy their hotel rooms (at a discount to what they can get direct). The upgauging of planes from A319’s to A320’s and A321’s will lead to a big profit improvement and part of the plan to go from £6 per seat pre tax to £10.  Co is net cash but will not be cash generative in the next 2 years as they buy the new planes (which will have a very good ROIC). There has been almost no new capacity for inter EU short haul since Covid and they are well placed at slot constrained airports. Trades on 6.5x PE in the prior decade the average was around 12x.  Met them recently and don’t anticipate a downgrade for FY and they are not taking the O’Leary view that pricing is strong for the key summer period (he is guiding up MSD).

[31/03/2025, 09:33:48] ~ Chris Dale: Stelios not involved in running the business. They negotiated a royal stream for the name. Have generally been quite a noisy and hostile investor. The shift to holidays was a genius move by Johan and the new CEO Kenton Jarvis was the CFO and is excellent IMO. Didn’t mention but it is estimated by some brokers to trade at 0.5x the value of the actual planes.

[01/04/2025, 08:29:32] Nick finegold: Key Points Summary:
	•	FTC Update:
	•	Cancellation window complete.
	•	Gross impact of approximately $445K and net impact of about $300K in total ARR.
	•	Among the small school district cohort, 92% (60 of 65) remained, with four customers expanding their deployments.
	•	The FTC effort is viewed as a significant waste of resources.
	•	Financial Restatement:
	•	Revised revenue shift impact is now estimated at $3MM (down from the original $4-6MM).
	•	This shift affects the timing of revenue recognition, not the total revenue.
	•	Liquidity:
	•	Q1 cash burn was $17MM due to one-time expenses related to the investigation, near completion of the financial restatement, a reduction in force (40 employees), and the timing of the 2024 annual incentive program disbursements.
	•	The high Q1 cash usage is temporary; the company projects EBITDA positive in Q2 and cash flow positive in Q4.
	•	No equity financing is planned; future ARR may be securitized to accelerate growth if opportunities arise.

[01/04/2025, 15:45:31] ~ Ben Finegold: “QLE and ASPI we could see valuations go well above $8b with each entity having possibly valuations of $3b+ (QLE) and $5b+ (ASPI). This is an incredible opportunity that does not come around very often.”

[01/04/2025, 15:45:32] ~ Ben Finegold: “Although this valuation seems gaudy at $42/s it’s only because the current market cap is $300mm and it is hard to de-anchor yourself from that price. The risk is massively reduced from the company and its really only a timeline and operational cost (which are both minimal and the company is moving at a blazing speed). When you look logically at how well this company can scale and understand the realistic potential of the company, it makes the current $4 price absolutely ludicrous now that the tech has been proven commercially. Overall this will be a long term hold for the Fund and we remain as confident as ever.”

A 2 year product issued by multiple “A” rated banks in GBP.  
100% cap guaranteed- subject to issuer risk.  
You get the upside in the underlying, but there is a “Cap on your upside”. 
Note, you are protected on the downside. 
SPX cap is 15% (115%)
Eurostoxx 50 cap is 29.25% (129.25%)
Ftse 100 cap is 32.0% (132%)

TSM is in the middle of US expansion, will be interesting to watch what they do.
[02/04/2025, 22:08:08] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Why would Taiwan fight? (1) prosperity? They'll keep it anyway (2) democracy? Sadly most of the world is moving away from it (3) self-determination? See HK... If they had unconditional support, maybe, but that ship appears ready to sail. The two key companies caught in this are ASML (technology) and TSM (process).

[03/04/2025, 06:10:29] ~ Matt H: Japan does not impose import tariffs on vehicles, including those from the United States. However, imported vehicles are subject to several taxes: ￼
	•	Consumption Tax: A 10% tax applied to the vehicle’s value.
	•	Excise Tax: This varies based on the vehicle’s engine size and horsepower. ￼
	•	Vehicle Tax: An annual tax determined by the engine size and power of the vehicle. ￼

Additionally, imported vehicles must comply with Japanese safety and emission standards, which may necessitate modifications and inspections. It’s advisable to consult with Japanese customs or a customs broker for detailed information on the import process and associated costs.  ￼

[03/04/2025, 07:36:16] ~ Dipesh Patel: I suspect there will be a lot of dramatic journalism in coming days and weeks. IMHO there is nothing wrong morally or ethically with Trump's tariffs and probably not economically either. Every country should just do what Israel did last night and either match or remove US tariffs and then sort it's own fiscal mess. Even playing field. Why should one region get to charge 3x when it is charged x. Of course it'll be much more complex than that but that's not a mess created by Trump but by years trading inequity.
[03/04/2025, 07:39:02] ~ Dipesh Patel: There are a bunch of these. They are v interesting as not sure what Trump does with mega US brands / success stories that don't manufacture anything themselves but have it all outsourced in say Vietnam. I doubt suppliers can take the margin hit eg Foxconn for Apple unless Vietnam removes/matches US tariffs. Does Trump somehow give a special pardon? That would be very controversial which he likes but dangerous. ‎<This message was edited>

Cf the chart on mortgage delinquencies from last week. Whether or not US workers lose their jobs there is very little headroom in households.
[03/04/2025, 08:09:45] Nick finegold: And whether the jobs are done by automation or people is another big question .

[03/04/2025, 08:15:00] ~ Dipesh Patel: Fair point and agreed. I suspect you have to break things sometimes to put them back better. The timing is most likely not great. As above, if every country removed any inequity there would be no inflationary impact. Indeed, you could make it deflationary on a global basis
[03/04/2025, 08:17:22] ~ Tim Sykes: Breaking the World economy will eventually create a deflationary shock. Yes.

[03/04/2025, 08:51:50] Nick finegold: For Full disclosure I bought some Novo yesterday. 

Its 50% pull back seems to take on board tariffs , new competition, and price cuts . 

What it’s ignoring is that the market is big enough for everyone , and Lilly will be subjected to the same barriers as Wegovy in the rest of the world . Does anyone really care about 22% vs 25% weight loss ? They will care more about price is my guess and whether it agrees with you. 

 I also took a deep dive into the work at the foundation and it’s mind blowing what they are doing in drug discovery with no cost to Novo shareholders . Nvidia quantum etc . 

It’s back at 17x and given I listened to an expert say it would take 12 years to roll out these drugs through the NHS to everyone who needed them just in the UK , I think this is a production game now and no one is better positioned than them in that regard . 

It’s back in a territory where it’s a great defensive play and not well owned in alpha capture systems anymore  . We had that confirmed yesterday . ‎<This message was edited>

[03/04/2025, 10:33:57] ~ David Haysey: The 5Y/5Y swap rates at 2.22 (just below Germany!) suggest that inflation isn’t a concern medium term; unsurprisingly these are towards the lower end of the range as deflationary implications of tariff war trump (sorry) the one-off hit unless he escalates of the tariffs. It’s possible we’ve been looking for signs of method in the madness and there just isn’t any.
The 5Y5Y figures quite prominently in Fed thinking.

So downside protected, and you get the upside as well but “capped”.  If at “maturity” gold etf is above a specific level “the cap” - you get your capital back and a “smaller rebate”.

So I felt I could flag again his Global L/S fund which is tiny and he smokes Gitanes and drjnks copious expresso but having been +96.7% in ‘21 and 94% in ‘22 so far in ‘25 is +120% in 2 mths and +32% in April alone. So is I think now #1 Equity L/S globally YTD.
I just spoke to him at length clouded in smoke and he is very and fabulously clear on his positioning! 
Its good Nutstuff and the Collective have access to Funds and Resources like this. Anyone who wants a chat with Jacques its never boring and NF and me are discussing ways to get him engaged .

[04/04/2025, 14:34:48] ~ Jonny Haycock: The point you make Mark about the state directing flows, capital controls is key. That’s coming. Anecdote. I’ve just walked out of a meeting with medium sized wealth manager with an SEC registration here in Switzerland and they are being overwhelmed by enquiries from HNW US citizens desperate to get an allocation of their wealth out of the US. ‎<This message was edited>

[04/04/2025, 15:53:08] ~ Tom Wiggin: I suspect that there’s no backtrack here.    At best there is a re-negotiation and movement of rates etc.   certainly there appears to be a willingness to reduce them in exchange for a reduction the other way.   

As a 2nd but related thought,   There was an article in the Telegraph (I think) that made the honest and obvious point that Tariffs are not more inflationary than net zero rules, or trades unions, or diversity requirements or health and safety and yet no one gets particularly excited by the costs that they impose.     
Trump definitely cares about the S&P performance during his term - but does he care about it short term and I would suspect probably not.    (Probably got a huge PA short on !!)

He had no intention of leaving in 2020. On the redemption tour, he is fixing everything that went against him the first time. He’s not leaving if he’s still there in 2028

[04/04/2025, 17:55:47] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Yep. Several functions of the USTs compressed into one number: indicator  of growth, of inflation expectations, of gov deficits and the risk-free asset.  Current action prices #1. What next? Simple heuristics don't work here, note that the heuristic risk off->$ up hasn't worked and many ppl still don't get why.

[05/04/2025, 09:05:29] ~ Andrew Draycott: My calls on India suggest they will rapidly accelerate their bilateral trade negotiations to get a deal by September. I expect significant concessions to close the trade deficit largely based around oil and gas purchases as military hardware. The Indian rhetoric is very conciliatory and the opposite to China, which is expected to from the other heavily affected like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam. But the deficits of all three are insignificant relative to China and the EU obviously.
[05/04/2025, 09:29:25] ~ Matt H: Having watched the gold market for 20 odd years and been a long term bull I would just caution that in all big market sell offs gold is likely to come off initially. I am hoping I am wrong. My largest PA holding is in a gold company, however my 2nd is Blackrock overnight sterling money market fund. I have a bit of FTSE100 in ISF but wondering if I should cut it. It’s hard to have conviction on anythig at the moment and I don’t mind missing some performance until there is direction.
[05/04/2025, 09:38:12] ~ Matt H: Comex copper still trading at almost $1000 premium to LME. Shorting Comex and long LME could be an interesting low risk trade. US users of copper have largely restocked. Chinese buyers usually come in when the LME price goes sub $9k.

I think the miscalculation is not what happens at home but what happens to US companies that have been so successful abroad.

I am afraid I think we are on for a full blown crash now and at this point the Mag 7 and all the big liquid stocks just become liquidity pools because you can’t really sell very much else. 

The best thing I have heard still remains the CEO of Sales force , it’s not the “what” it’s the “how” they are doing things. 

Scott Beasant can sit there all he likes and make a case for the “what” but the  “how” they have set about the task is the most heinously stupid thing I have ever seen . His arguments may be sound intellectually but he is a f*cking moron if he thinks this is the way to set about the task and is in anyway in the interests of anyone especially American workers . That’s the bottom line , it’s a grotesque miscalculation, they will not be forgiven and America’s global businesses will suffer as will everyone else .

The can should not have been kicked this far down the road for sure but creating a confidence vacuum is simply mental . 

Tucker Carlson and the All in Podcast team were truly awful . They didn’t challenge him on anything . They were a disgrace to Jornalism and sycophants. 

I may also hate this moron below even more than Trump  .

I call it “The Katie Price” dilema. “TRIPLE-D’s” doesnt work anymore. DEMOGRAPHICS DEBT & DEI.
Recall this: KATIE Price says she has had so many facelifts that passport scanners no longer recognise her. The TV personality, 46, finds it a problem when travelling to places like Turkey, where she has had several surgeries.
Nutstuff notes Katies recent trauma, “too big and people don’t recognise her anymore “?!!…what does she do next? The question is especially pertinent for the UK which similarly faces the same triple D problem. There comes a point “Katie” when the same trick has declining cost/benefit ratio, bite the bullet, deflate your liabilities restructure your life and invest in your future, your children and not yourself!
[07/04/2025, 22:18:08] ~ Andrew Cawker: UK PM’s reporting that discussions with housebuilders are suggesting that they are seeing real action from the UK Govnt on liberating planning.

It’s a crazy time so I don’t want to police things too carefully because this should be fun,  but just a gentle reminder this group is primarily for great equity ideas of which there should be many now post the drop.  

Indra & Bawag from Chris was a great example of that both of which will be written up . 

In a couple of weeks Katie starts who will help me run the whole club.

One of her many tasks including helping a frail old man who lacks confidence and turns 60 , June 3rd , will be to pull the very best alpha out this group , get showcases built  ,  put the companies concerned on shareflix and in diamonds chat group  we have set up , so that those who don’t have the time to read  the rich Shakespearean language of Will Nutting ,and others just great ideas on tap. 

Thanks again , as I said it’s important to have fun in this group, but there should some banging ideas post the correction and it would be nice to get some on the chat as these stocks  provide entry points that were unimaginable a few weeks ago.

[08/04/2025, 07:19:14] ~ Dipesh Patel: A couple of opportunities to highlight. Barclays which has been on the club watch list and may still be, has had a proper thump from 310 to 230 yesterday. I don't think it's earnings get caught up in the direct trade wars and firmly believe FI will continue to remain v strong. Of course you take recession knock on risk but that's with most stocks I feel. If UK/EU banks get any benefit from any US boycotting, Barclays FI business can really outperform as well. It's on 6x. If I'm bottom fishing anything in the downdraft, I want it to be cheap and I may need to live with those earnings for some time.

China - as per yesterday, I don't think it makes any sense for WH to take them on. China has already derated to a domestic playbook and had a 4 year sell off. Also v underowned. I suspect it comes through OK as it actually does have the manufacturing ability the US wants to build. For anyone looking to play China outside of single names/stock risk, KWEB has been mentioned here, but I would also add China A50. I trade that a fair bit. It's on most platforms like IG. Very liquid and represents a lot of those domestic plays. Money exiting US will need to go somewhere. Thought would mention for anyone looking at options to play China.
[08/04/2025, 07:45:30] ~ Andrew Cawker: I thought this note from Savvas was interesting, especially for the last few paragraphs. It underlines the potential in many UK names:- 

“Regardless of who had shockingly taken the Oval Office, the world would have continued ITS GREAT economic ROTATION. A rebalancing that is, in which the UK, & regardless of its own political shift, CANNOT FAIL TO see more wealth coming into its fiduciary & physical assets, & more human capital too.

So, if you are involved in selling or renting prime residential in the UK capital or for that matter commercial space, be prepared for enquiries from financially well-endowed human capital spanning the fields of tech, media, entertainment, finance & beyond. If you are in recruitment, be ready too, for these types retaining your business services, for their own business hiring needs.”

[08/04/2025, 07:47:20] ~ Andrew Cawker: Plenty of UK stocks (including Barclays and the REITS) looking cheap, with potential flows turning towards the UK as the ‘cleanest shirt in the Western dirty laundry basket’
[08/04/2025, 07:55:30] ~ William Nutting: Yes for sure. Whats interesting IMHO  is to see the names in UK ( and US) that have held their 5yr and many even all time highs! Even through all this, big fat dividends sailing through. The clue is think “Addiction and Needs” they also pay their taxes. Stark contrast to “wants and aspirations” who rip off common shareholders with egregious option issuance and dodge their taxes in places like Dublin. Now will have to pay higher salaries to retain employees or replace with robots as options now worthless. These are the 5 yr lows and likely going lower.
Its simply Maslows Hierarchy /Pyramid. 
All the Market cap in indexes esp in US is in Wants and hardly any in Needs.
[08/04/2025, 08:31:09] ~ William Nutting: NF am scribing Nutstuff short paragraphs on a few names to publish tomorrow where are back a long long way , way beyond the indexes they are part of…

Love you to work your AI magic on a few ans happy to help. 

*Tech: AMD TSM( others here too) 
*Uranium: YCA LN ( buy back zone surely?!) 
*2 x US “Offshore” drillers. ( yes Shale is “terminal” now).
*UK: housebuilding contrarianism. ( others here sniffing). Net Zero has to be shelved or shutttered for now= so what are the most hated UK listed names that can have 200-300% re-ratings? There is a key catalyst imminent here.
[08/04/2025, 08:54:36] ~ Mark: Yes please to your list….
[08/04/2025, 09:17:19] ~ Andrew Cawker: - Housebuilders ✅. 
  - Brick manufacturers (Forterra etc on normalising volumes and margins) 
- Dull but worthy REITS (BLND for example - 50% discount to NAV now, 6.7% yield and return to office in full swing in the City). 
And Plenty of UK mid cap stocks to pick from. 

None 200% reratings but worthy portfolio stocks. 

Key is to watch for flows as UK Domestic DC pensions and wealth managers consider not only Equity allocation to US but also $ risk now - given their £ investors. $ has been a great tailwind for them. If I was to chair an asset allocation committee, fx exposure would be near the top of the list to talk about.

[08/04/2025, 21:14:55] ~ Mark Lewis: Everyone talking about the Trump escalation on China tariffs and that is bad enough but what about China freezing exports of rare earths to the US and ALL other countries?

So, two things going on:

1) increasing the cost of Chinese imports to US consumers will make so many staple manufactured goods unaffordable overnight to low and middle-income Americans, while also increasing inflation dramatically and this forcing the Fed to keep rates high until something breaks. It is going to be a catastrophe for the US retail sector. Walmart and Target will crater.

2) China is restricting the export of rare earths to ALL countries, not just the US.

In other words, China has established a mechanism to embargo the US from access to any and all manufactured goods if and when it so chooses.

Trump has brought a knife to a gunfight while Xi has brought a bazooka.

The US is about to find out that the 20th Century was the American century but the 21st Century is the Chinese century.

Trump’s bluff has been called and it is going to destroy him politically and show that China is now the pre-eminent global superpower.

At least we now know what MAGA stands for:

[08/04/2025, 21:18:50] ~ Mark Lewis: Of course, huge risk there but beyond my pay-grade. Trump seems happier with economic warfare than actual military warfare so far. 

And he has massively overestimated the economic power of the US versus China and the rest of the world. 

China are up for the fight, Trump and his cronies are utterly clueless. 

Also, will love to see how Musk squares this circle given his business interests in China.
[08/04/2025, 21:21:04] Nick finegold: If you speak to Adam Jonas he has had China as a zero in his Tesla forecasts for many years . 

It was always unlikely China would let American data gathering cars persist for long .
[08/04/2025, 21:24:31] ~ Mark Lewis: Point is China can choke off critical resources and supply chains to western markets at any time if they want to — and Trump is giving them the perfect excuse. 

Hence China’s ban today on exports of rare earths.
[08/04/2025, 21:25:03] ~ William Nutting: China have been planning this for 8yrs…
[08/04/2025, 21:25:57] ~ Stretch: How come the USA didn’t know this? How come they didn’t know that this was the play?
[08/04/2025, 21:26:21] ~ Mark Lewis: Western financial analysts and MSM completely clueless when it comes to China. Xi now dousing them in scalding hot coffee to wake them up.
[08/04/2025, 21:27:01] ~ Mark Lewis: Because they live in a self-created echo chamber and know nothing about the rest of the world.

Perhaps giving Trump a warning shot - look what could happen if you don’t walk back the threats tomorrow.
Also note CNY been weakening all evening - devaluation another tool available to China. Trading 7.42 now.
[08/04/2025, 22:09:12] ~ Rich McDonald: That could set up a brinkmanship situation for tomorrow - Trump calls the “win” by delaying tariffs by a month, and scheduling a meeting between the two in early May.

[08/04/2025, 22:18:14] ~ Dipesh Patel: I think things continue to play out in favour of China over US. Yes saw the bonds move today and could well be China especially if there is any threat to suspending interest payments. I think "let's talk in May" US mkts +7% is v wishful. US mkts increasingly uninvestible

[09/04/2025, 05:35:19] ~ Andrew Draycott: The Indian FM yesterday sounded increasingly hawkish, especially around Chinese dumping, using Vietnam and Bangladesh to assemble and circumvent into India, as they have lower barriers. Increasingly the fear is non US Chinese exports finding their way into other markets which could have the knock on effect of greater protectionist measures elsewhere. India is already far too protectionist, but I expect a bi lateral trade agreement with the US by September, and the UK and EU this year. It’s also far more insulated due to exports only accounting for 9% of gdp. My bigger concern is the Chinese devaluating the yuan which will take most em currency with it, but the collapse in oil is a significant boon for their BoPs.

the problem - The main markets for Lynas Rare Earths’ products:
	1.	China: The largest destination by value for Lynas’ separated rare earths, reflecting China’s significant role in the global rare earth supply chain.
	2.	Japan: A key market, particularly for high-performance magnets used in automotive and electronics industries.

[09/04/2025, 06:37:18] ~ David M. Ryan: Apple already moving a portion of IPhone production to India — Tata Electronics under supervision from Foxconn … I guess this will accelerate
[09/04/2025, 06:49:35] ~ Mark Lewis: This will be a very interesting case study given that China is banning the export of rare earths to all countries not just the US. So although making iPhones in India will be a LOT cheaper than making them in the USA, if China really does play hardball on rare earths then it will still be much more expensive to produce them in India than in China and the scale of production in India will only ever be a fraction of Chinese production. 

Nobody is ready for any of this, but it is a very safe bet that China is much better prepared than Trump and C-minus student Navarro.

[09/04/2025, 07:22:36] ~ Andrew Draycott: My understanding was that light rare earths are ubiquitous (Lynas) but heavy rare earths are scarce? China does the latter but the Aussies have quite a lot (I met the scientist from northern minerals who have a deposit NTU AU) and it reminded me why I shouldn’t have been trying to burn the desk in chemistry instead of learning the periodic table. Anyway they have significant heavy rare earths but it’s blood hard to get out the ground, hence the awful share price.

Trump's announced he's going after pharma imports next, apparently in next few days. Clearly EU pharma is a big exporter into US but most searches do throw up Novo as being most dependent on US, mainly because of the concentration risk of their 2 obesity drugs. In any case, if Trump does get as crazy with Pharma as he is with China, it may get v unhealthy (sorry). I have no position in any of the names. Was looking to short but they're already down so much.

[09/04/2025, 18:51:55] ~ William Nutting: So the market seems to be making its mind up.
Nutstuff is guessing we finally have the beginnings of an outline of what the tariff off ramp looks like to Trump. First all world leaders need to bow down kiss the ring of the king in the oval office - or in trumps words last night at a Republican dinner "kiss my ass". Then he wants zero tariffs and then he wants something a little extra from each country and it will be different or what he calls bespoke - from China he wants a sale of tik-tok to a US group (although why, who knows) and an end of artificial management of the yuan; back doors to US via korea mexico japan etc stops, from Europe he wants more US exports of natural gas (already the EU buys 45% of its supply from the US) and mitigation of the "lawfare"/regulation of US tech firms etc etc. He wants to show America he is the greatest deal maker and can do things that other american presidents never did; he wants to show that America can throw its weight around and bully and intimidate others into submission. Most countries will grit their teeth and do a deal but they will never forgive the humiliation and in many ways, and in some we cant even fathom, the US will one day pay the price for this. Some, like China, may hold out and may even get the better of Trump. There will be a list of good countries Trump wants to deal with first - like Japan, South Korea, Israel and the UK - and those countries like Vietnam with whom he must get a quick deal  in the face of the disintegrating supply chains of businesses like Apple,  Gap, Nike, Coca Cola and Intel etc. And we know that Japan, South Korea and Vietnam are all in frenzied meetings with their Washington counterparts right now trying desperately to get a quick deal done this week. Other countries who are not on Trumps list - think Africa especially South Africa - may not get a look in for some time and could even be left out in the cold. Whilst there is plenty of room for further f** up, own goals and global economic sabotage its not going to be a surprise to see a deal or two done in the coming days and certainly by the end of next week.
[09/04/2025, 19:05:28] ~ Andrew Draycott: Not sure frozen trade between the two largest economies in the world will be quite so easily surmounted even if he sees it as victory. Humiliating the Chinese is never a smart idea, when Taiwan is always front of mind. Could be a colossal miscalculation and the ten percent tariffs still remain so friction is far from off.

Sylvest's exit comes after Morten Lammert's resignation in March to join rival Roche Holding AG, and is the company's second high-profile departure in a month.
 He will join the Swiss drug maker in June as global therapeutic area head for cardiovascular, renal and metabolism, amid a push for Roche to enter the hyper-competitive market for obesity drugs.

[11/04/2025, 08:57:37] ~ Andrew Draycott: Redman’s base case is now for a Trump-inflicted US recession. Even with a reprieve from “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs, the remaining levies (including 125% on China) take US protectionism to levels unseen since the 1940s.
With record-high policy uncertainty, corporate and household confidence is cratering, freezing investment and all but ensuring a self-fulfilling US recession.
Forward employment surveys are already deep into contractionary territory.
Within the chaos emanating from the White House, we have sought protection in Asia-Pacific markets with moats for 2025.

We set out 10 reasons why India ranks as our preferred regional overweight.


 1.  India is among the least sensitive to Trump’s tariff onslaught
 2.  India’s economy is more domestically driven than peers’
 3.  The equity market is five-sixths domestically owned
 4.  Foreign investors remain (marginally) underexposed to India
 5.  The rupee seems relatively well supported by external dynamics
 6.  The most negative EPS revisions momentum has likely passed
 7.  India offers meaningfully superior value creation relative to EM
 8.  It looks like issuance has moved past the market saturation point
 9.  The correction has delivered somewhat more palatable valuation
 10. India has double the model-derived 12m return forecast of EM

April 11 (Reuters) – JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter profit rose 9% as it earned more from dealmaking and trading. 
Earnings were $14.6 billion, or $5.07 a share, for the three months ended March 31, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday. That compares with $13.4 billion, or $4.44 a share, a year earlier. 
Investment banking fees rose 12% to $2.2 billion. Trading revenue climbed 21%, higher than the earlier expectations of a low double-digits percentage gain.

[11/04/2025, 12:03:55] ~ Giles Fitzpatrick: April 11 (Reuters) – BlackRock posted a drop in first-quarter profit on Friday as the world's largest asset manager took a hit from higher expenses. 
Stock markets also faltered in the first quarter of 2025 after a strong run last year as the Trump administration's erratic approach to trade policy kept investors on the back foot. 
"Uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations. We've seen periods like this before when there were large, structural shifts in policy and markets – like the financial crisis, COVID, and surging inflation in 2022," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. 
The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 4.6% in the first quarter of 2025, its worst start to a year since 2022. 
Total expenses in the quarter rose to $3.58 billion from $3.04 billion last year. 
However, assets under management at the New York firm rose to $11.58 trillion from $10.47 trillion last year, as investors poured into exchange traded funds and other low-risk products. 
Adjusted profit in the quarter rose to $11.30 per share in the first three months of 2025, compared with $9.81 per share a year ago.

Thanks for weekly update. Two thoughts - I believe there will be a managed reduction in Japanese treasury holdings and repatriation, so my bet is on the Yen strengthening from here this year…
Gold /silver ratio now 103x. Apart from a brief spike early 2020 this is way above 20 year levels. So either gold falls, or silver goes up strongly…,in 2020 silver rose 80% in 3 months….
[12/04/2025, 03:55:41] ~ Mark: At 85x silver would now be $38….
[12/04/2025, 04:07:16] ~ Matt H: Who will be the beneficiary? Will people head east instead of west?
[12/04/2025, 04:26:24] ~ Matt H: I would argue that silver is not a currency like gold. It’s partly an industrial metal and the rest of demand is often punters & conspiracy theorists. The big boys (Central banks)don’t buy it. It’s not liquid enough. That said inventories are quite low and it could get squeezed. 
Fresnillo is the world’s largest producer. In 2024 is produced 56moz of silver and just over 600koz of gold. In 2025 production of silver should remain the same while gold production will be around 10% lower than in 2024. The company should be making margins of 50-60% plus on around $4bn of revenue and being a family owned business they will pay out a significant proportion to shareholders.

[12/04/2025, 11:28:13] ~ William Nutting: British Steels demise: FFS!!!Nutstuffs thoughts and positioning on the needless economic suicide of net zero and importing expensive power and commodities should be very clear. 
I was watching the UK Parliament being recalled today for an Emergency debate on British Steel/ Scunthorpe, which is in session right now…
Honestly; this has Feck all to do with Donald Trump and tariffs. 
This plant has lost £700k a day for its Chinese owners largely for one key reason. The rest is utter Waffle and BS..
Scunthorpe's key significant challenge is the exorbitant energy costs, which substantially contribute to the company's unprofitability in international markets.
Yes AFN is right: “You screw working class steel workers when you allow a white collar metropolitan, middle class Labour Party to turn British industrial energy costs into the most expensive in the world in pursuit of a bourgeois obsession with net zero.”
The Government could cut energy costs by £100s overnight with a few simple policy choices: Scrap the CCL and UK ETS
Recover subsidy and capacity market costs through taxation rather than through bills. 
Then to help industry further they should cut business taxes and slash regulation.

[12/04/2025, 11:51:54] ~ Robin Maxwell: I asked my friend John Charlton-Jones, a career Japanese broker and NED at Chikara … this was his answer. “Currently the best performers are the ‘activist’ funds (AJOT and NAV) who are looking for b/s value that can be unlocked.  CCJI aka Chikara has the best long term performance of the rest, based on a selection of deep moats with growth and rising dividend returns.  Investors should have a bit of both. Govt and TSE-led corporate governance reforms mean that compound growth in shareholder returns should be strong for some time.  The missing ingredient - now being supplied by Trump - is higher rates and a stronger yen.  Just remember it’s all about company selection and not the domestic economy.”

Nutstuff on RARE-EARTHS & CHINA: Yes, It's almost comical it took this long; China had a giant red button labeled "Rare Earths" for over a decade, and everyone knew they'd eventually press it. China’s decision to halt rare earth exports to the U.S. is not just an economic move it’s a calibrated act of geostrategic disruption. Rare earths like dysprosium oxide may represent a minuscule portion of China’s export revenue, but they serve as critical arteries for U.S. industries: EVs, semiconductors, aerospace, and defense. And China knows full well that most U.S. firms operate without meaningful inventories sacrificing resilience for balance sheet optics. By targeting this vulnerability, Beijing exerts maximum strategic leverage at minimal domestic cost. Do we have a Plan B? Well its MP MATERIALS/  MP US!

Gary Paulin pointed out: Nationalism seems to be quite catching, after all. An industrial renaissance could also favour homegrown sectors like construction, aggregates, cement, and steel. Case in point: Vulcan Materials has delivered the second highest compound returns historically, and it’s hard to ship-in aggregates from abroad; tariffs will also make it harder (= more expensive) to ship steel in as well. One suspects Trump’s upcoming Made in America ETF will include these sorts of things. If you’re interested, he’s also filed an ETF for Energy Independence.

 There was a lot of general chat about the Netflix show “Adolescence” and how it was suggested it become compulsory viewing at schools etc.     I just watched “American Factory” also on Netflix.  It is a documentary about Fuyao, the Chinese auto glass manufacturer opening a factory in Dayton Ohio where the closure of the old GM plant left a lot of people out of work.  It dives into the issues that the Chinese have with American work ethics and productivity, the struggles with attempts to unionise etc etc and finishes with the slightly obvious-from-the-beginning observation that robotics can solve for a lot of the problems.  
I thoroughly recommend it -  maybe Uncle Donald and his gang somehow missed it …….

He isn’t talking about a downturn. He’s calling time on the entire postwar monetary system. “The dollar’s cracking, the Fed’s bluffing, and Washington’s still sleepwalking.”
America’s internal contradictions—endless wars, crumbling infrastructure, ballooning entitlements—are now monetary contradictions. You can’t print your way out of decay. The political class won’t face this. The bond market sharpens its guillotine and nobody in Washington hears it over the printer. 
Dalio sees the trap: raise rates and you bankrupt the state. Cut rates and you trash the currency. Keep pretending you can do both, and you lose the credibility needed to do either. 
The Fed isn’t the Fed anymore. It’s a janitor with a mop, chasing spills it caused. And inflation isn’t “transitory” when your credibility is. The US dollar isn’t just a currency anymore. It’s a geopolitical cudgel. And the moment your money becomes a weapon, people start building escape hatches. Think BRICS. BTC Think gold. Think anything but Treasuries. 
This is the point where empires get downgraded. De-dollarisation is not a fantasy. It’s already here. Quiet, incremental, but accelerating. Countries are dumping Treasuries and hedging bets. The American Empire is being unwound by Excel sheets. 
If Ray Dalio says something “much worse than a recession” is coming you better buy some f**** Bitcoin.

Of the 100 that are due in next 4 years, only 9 are in 2025, 17 in 2026, 30 in 2027 and 43 in 2028. This delivery schedule was pushed back by easyJet at YE24 results back in November - so they got ahead of disclosing these delays a bit already. Fleet upgrade from old A319’s to A320 neo is key part of medium-term thesis for them.

[17/04/2025, 11:48:32] ~ Ant: UNH (UnitedHealth) reported a shortfall on Q1 EPS (7.20 vs. the Street 7.27) and revenue ($109.6B vs. the Street $11.55B), and the full-year guidance is being cut (they now see EPS of $26.25 at the mid-point, down from the prior $29.75 forecast). The United Healthcare business performed better than expected on revenue and the MCR (84.8% vs. the Street 85.75%), but Optum fell short (Optum revenue was $63.9B vs. the Street $67.1B). Mgmt. acknowledges it did “not perform up to our expectations” and promises to “aggressively address” the challenges facing the company (the company implies its issues are very fixable and suggests they will be fully resolved by the end of the year). Three factors were called out for the earnings pressure: 1) heightened care activity indications within UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Advantage businesses; 2) unanticipated changes in the profile of Optum Health members impacting planned 2025 reimbursement; and 3) ongoing Medicare funding reductions enacted by the previous administration.
[17/04/2025, 11:48:51] ~ JB: Shares have been strong due to recent announcement of higher Medicare payments for 2025 and being a domestic play.  Mgmt also normally upgrades through the year.   The call will be very key.

When people compare him to Volcker, they need to remember that Reagan campaigned on and his Treasury was fully on board with killing inflation.  What is happening now is similar but different; cutting the deficit (2 trillion) is deflationary, trade tactics are deflationary, the one time-shock to inflation is not inflation - inflation is monetary. The Fed needs to counter these deflationary shocks by cutting rates. I would even argue the Fed needs to monetize (buy and hold treasuries to lower Federal interest costs by having it flow back to Treasury). Treasury and Fed are supposed to work in tandem not against one another.

[18/04/2025, 08:46:01] Nick finegold: RARE EARTHS:

The Big Picture:
America’s tariff-heavy strategy in the rare earths trade war is backfiring—fast. With China tightening controls on critical exports, U.S. industry is staring down a supply crisis, and the White House is scrambling to course-correct.

⸻

1. Tariffs Trigger Trade Turmoil
What happened: The U.S. slapped across-the-board tariffs on rare earths—excluding magnets—but forgot to check if it could actually replace Chinese supply. Spoiler: it can’t.
Why it matters: Nearly 7,500 tons of rare earth magnets imported from China in 2024 now face tariffs. There’s no short- or mid-term substitute.

“Mutually Assured Destruction isn’t just nuclear—it’s trade, too.”

⸻

2. Defense Industry in a Bind
China’s move: Beijing has locked out U.S. defense contractors from access to dual-use rare earths, hitting critical components: samarium-cobalt magnets, dysprosium, terbium, and others.
Impact: U.S. defense supply chains are stalled. The eVAC project is the only domestic magnet hope—and it’s still China-reliant.
Bonus pain: Samarium just vanished from U.S. supply.

⸻

3. Lanthanum: China’s Ace
Why it matters: 63% of U.S. rare earth imports from China are lanthanum, vital for gasoline production.
What if China halts exports? Pump prices could spike 30%—a political death sentence in an election year.

⸻

4. MP Materials: A Case Study in Vulnerability
Despite U.S. support: MP Materials lost 73 cents per $1 of revenue in 2024. Its fate is tied to Chinese partner Shenghe.
Tariffs on bastnaesite ore (MP’s core product) = lights out.

⸻

5. Reactionary Policy: White House in Whiplash Mode
New exec order: “National Security & Economic Resilience through Section 232 Actions.”
The irony: Existing legislation already covers it. Critics call it performative and duplicative.

⸻

6. Lobbyists Swarm, Projects Flounder
Snake oil season: Bad actors are exploiting the panic for handouts.
Data drought: Most U.S. rare earth startups (MP, Noveon, USA Rare Earth) publish no material performance data.

⸻

7. Global Chessboard
	•	Saudi Arabia: Courting RE processing partners (incl. MP & Shenghe) despite unclear domestic resources.
	•	Australia: Mulling a critical minerals stockpile—purpose and beneficiaries TBD.
	•	Kiribati: Talking deep-sea mining with China. The desperation is showing.

⸻

Bottom Line:
The U.S. shot first and is now dealing with the recoil. Without realistic domestic alternatives, defense readiness, energy resilience, and trade leverage are under threat. China isn’t blinking.
[18/04/2025, 08:50:19] Nick finegold: ‎POLL:
In attempting to gain supply chain security it’s possible these tariffs cut off the US from minerals critical to almost every aspect of defence and manufacturing.

[21/04/2025, 08:08:21] ~ William Nutting: Think Donald Dystopian Dollar Discount & Gold & BTC vs  $<99… 

Nutstuff is a simple soul and I would simply heed the words below of the “other” Stan! General Stanley McChrystal (not Druckenmiller). The “Donald Dystopian Discount“ is reality! ( The word dystopia comes from the Ancient Greek dus (“bad”) and topos (“place”), literally meaning “bad place”) Trumps ranting Easter message even stretching to say, “oh its just Trump” is simply not acceptable and it sends a “ bad place” message. $ holders really dont like it but alternatives to the $ do! 

"When our leaders abandon character, it does more than set a poor example. It accelerates decay. It tells people that principles are optional, that decency is weakness, that rules are for fools. It fosters a culture of fear, where hesitation replaces confidence, cynicism replaces trust and self-preservation replaces the courage to stand for what is right. When those at the top abandon the standards that hold society together, the rest of us, knowingly or not, follow suit. And when enough people do, the foundation doesn’t just erode. It crumbles. We cannot afford to let this stand.”

AGAIN: the moves in Gold & BTC up / and $ down are utterly emblematic of this. Bitcoin should start ripping here as the global chase for a neutral reserve asset accelerates. YES GOLD is running hard and $22 trillion vs BITCOIN $1.7 Trillion. Remember however that If you are a private citizen, you can buy Bitcoin and send it anywhere for basically nothing. What if you want to send physical Gold? Well it better not be to a BRIC: Brazil charges 12%, Russia Charges 20%, India charges 18% and China forbids it.

Tesla numbers today are largely irrelevant IF their cars become uncompetitive on charging and range. 

Solid state has long been touted as a game changer but still seems some way off . I repeat we should be obsessing about battery tech , when it comes to Ev’s , not just tariffs and rare earths for magnets . 

Tesla is now back to where it was pre the Trump bump . I suspect it’s still a world class short .

[22/04/2025, 08:01:30] ~ JB: Degradation is key. I gave my Mercedes EQC back after 3 years due to 1/3 degradation of the fully charged battery.  
300miles to 200miles.

[22/04/2025, 08:04:15] ~ Matt H: So swapping them as above could be the solution. If it can be done cheap enough.
[22/04/2025, 08:05:17] Nick finegold: Easier to do with hydrogen cartridges if you believe Toyota . My point is that there are a lot of edge risks .
[22/04/2025, 08:17:36] ~ JB: Under current technology. 

IMHO - autonomous vehicles (Waymo is rolling out its AV taxi service - as are others) will have a much bigger impact on the auto industry.
[22/04/2025, 08:22:10] ~ William Nutting: “You meet the nicest people at EV charging stations”…

The serious point is even the most ardent Tesla fans are incredulous that Elon seems to be putting all his technology eggs into a (imo) not as big as you think AV basket. 
Meanwhile I remain absolutely befuddled at the apparent inertia of literally all non-Chinese companies to invest in battery tech. It’s like the entire world has thrown its hands in the air and just given up trying to compete… which strikes me as a rather dangerous geopolitical state of affairs
[22/04/2025, 08:49:26] ~ Chris Dale: The lack of investment by German OEM’s particularly is well covered by the recent book I am reading called Kaput. It’s less about what’s going to happen but more of a review of the almost anti tech culture in Germany over the last 30 years. They didn’t take EV’s seriously as they weren’t ’proper cars’. German OEM’s are now
In a terrible place. One potential bright spot is that the engineering capability is now going to be turned full circle in developing Europe’s defence sector. Underlying skills are available in a way that deindustrialising the U.K. and the US will require years of investment and training of workers.
[22/04/2025, 08:50:09] ~ Robin Maxwell: Oil spec net short now at all time high of 150m barrels (paper) acc to Martijn Rats, MS Chief Commodity Strategist. Also saying oil v Gold at 100 yr low (but for that brief moment in Covid). Someone else saying same Gold v Silver earlier. Fresnillo spec buy ?
[22/04/2025, 08:57:59] ~ Robin Maxwell: German Auto OEM's capex not dissimilar to NHS funding - numbers over past 3 decades have been huge but was it efficiently deployed ? Rarely. I wrote about this 30 years ago when I was a VW analyst ! You touch though on a super critical point - companies like VW (in particular VW actually) have the capability to transition some production into quasi-defence manufacturing capacity...and some of it could be re-tooled quite quickly. The engineering skill set is in place. Apart from the 66% drawdown this is the main/only reason why I put one toe in VW stock in 1Q. Will be watching carefully.
[22/04/2025, 09:00:33] ~ Chris Dale: Apologies…I wasn’t clear. I don’t see this as a positive for VW. Just that the autos industry in Germany will be reslilled into Defence but not that VW will be much of a beneficiary. Rheinmetal (RHM GY) has done amazingly well but is the stock to play this in my
Opinion
[22/04/2025, 09:01:36] Nick finegold: I believe VW have defence in their history !
[22/04/2025, 09:06:48] ~ William Nutting: More attack! 

Agree Chris. RHM & Leonardo and Babcock. BAE too maybe. The European defence industry in a world that really doesn’t need F35’s and big platforms  can eat the US companies lunch …
[22/04/2025, 09:08:51] Nick finegold: Chris , is the point with Indra that air defence is going to be required vs missiles and drones , is that the key driver .

[22/04/2025, 16:55:06] Nick finegold: On Tesla , my guess is that the results are a car crash , awful beyond our wildest imaginations , not necessarily the quarter on quarter numbers which reflect a historic metric but the ourlook can only be bad , of that I am certain . 

To mitigate this Musk will announce that he will return , in some form to fix the disaster he has caused . This will be confusing , but the bottom line is that this is not a “ robots and autonomous cars will populate the earth”  type of market people , want real money and companies at a reasonable prices, everything Tesla isn’t .

So there maybe a bit of a squeeze on return of the prodigal son , but then it’s an outright sell . ‎<This message was edited>

[22/04/2025, 19:39:33] ~ Chris Dale: From JB (a Spanish broker we talk to)

Indra. Spain announced a Eur10.5bn YoY increase in defence spending in 2025, thus reaching 2% of GDP (Eur33bn). This implies a 55% YoY increase in Security and Defence spending, which is well ahead of our 15% growth forecast. Even if we exclude the part of the plan related to communications and dual-use technologies, which we are not sure were part of the 2024 budget, we would still be talking about a 25% YoY increase vs 2024 – also comfortably  above our estimates. According to press reports, this increase will be funded without raising taxes or increasing public deficit, through: i) reallocation of Next Generation EU funds (including €1.3bn for cybersecurity), ii) interest savings on government debt, and iii) unused budget allocations from 2023. 87% of the funds will be allocated domestically and thus Indra should be a major beneficiary. We are just not sure how can domestic companies increase their capacity that much to face this surge in orders, namely taking to account we are already close to the end of April. We should have more details over the next days on how this budget increase will be implemented but anyway we do see the news as positive for Indra. We just do not know how positive and my analyst will chase.

[22/04/2025, 21:09:21] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Re increasing capacity that broker mentions: that is the core of the problem. In civil, Airbus is already constrained. Dassault Av has about 15y of Rafale orders at current production rates and that's before any new orders. RHM have said they can be v quick in setting up production sites from scratch but the challenge is whether their suppliers can.
[22/04/2025, 21:47:54] ~ Mehdi: Tesla earnings takeaways: expectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers

TSLA (Tesla) reported grim Q1 results vs. expectations, including total revenue -9% Y/Y to $19.33B (vs. the Street $22B), EPS -40% to 27c (vs. the Street 47c), and free cash flow ($664MM vs. the Street $1.66B). Mgmt. says the sales decline was driven by lower vehicle deliveries, lower vehicle ASPs, and FX, offset in part by growth in the energy business (auto revenue slumped 20% Y/Y while energy generation/storage revenue jumped 67%). The company finished the quarter with 22 days of auto inventory, a sharp spike from 12 days in Q4 and up modestly from 19 in Q3 and 18 in Q2. The aggregate GAAP gross margin fell 103bp Y/Y and held flat Q/Q at 16.3% (the core auto GM excluding regulatory credits was only 12.5%). “Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term”. The timelines for Robotaxi and Optimus are unchanged (“we remain on track for pilot launch of Robotaxi in Austin by June and builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories”). Tesla is still planning to commence production of a more affordable vehicle in H1:25, but there will be less cost savings associated with this product vs. prior expectations (“these vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. This approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times”). 

What bulls will say: expectations were already super low, so the Q1 numbers aren’t as bad as they look, and the timelines for critical products (Robotaxi, Optimus, and low-cost vehicle) are the same as before. It’s likely Musk’s days at DOGE are numbered, and his departure from that agency could help remove a major sales headwind.

What bears will say: while expectations may have been low, these are still ugly numbers, and there’s no reason to think things are about to get a lot better. Robotaxi is years behind Waymo, and the company downgraded its guidance for the expense savings associated with the new low-cost vehicle. Musk’s personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won’t change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive.
[22/04/2025, 22:16:28] Nick finegold: I will listen to the call . The initial jump is that the company remains cash flow positive . Reading the statement , the tariff shenanigans have provided the perfect .air cover for them to give no guidance .

[23/04/2025, 09:11:13] ~ Richard Windsor: Tesla: While I do not disagree with Elon's view of the world, it is, as ever, a question of time. 

1)Robotoaxis are already nearly 6 years late and are showing little sign of materialising in a big way any time soon. When Tesla finally gets its service to market, there will be tons of competition meaning that this is not an 80% GM business as confidently predicted but 20%. This is a different value proposition entirely

2) Robots. Again a huge opportunity but the time scale is all wrong. right now Robotics does not scale and most of the thorny problems are yet to be solved. 

Add this lot up and the stock is still a sell.
[23/04/2025, 09:56:25] ~ Dipesh Patel: I have. I think it's quite poor tbh. You've probably got an iPhone in which case it may seem OK because you don't have any  embedded AI.

I suspect there is a chance for raised guidance given expectations are below 2024 levels. Corporate lending growth ytd is booming at a 4-5yr peak, mortgages have had an OK start and probably benefit at the low end from a March rush to avoid stamp duty exemption and the IB should be strong on FI. The yield curve is also helping. Strong chance of a breakout in the stock.

If anything, though, the publicity event showed “how far robots still are from mimicking people”. Many of the machines never made it much beyond the starting line. One ended its race by “sitting down on the course and refusing to go further”; another began swinging around so much that it slammed into a fence and broke into pieces. The winning robot finished the race – after three battery changes – in 2hrs 40mins, a good hour and a half after the fastest human.

[24/04/2025, 12:11:42] Adam Clib: 💊Novo Nordisk is a name mentioned on here quite a lot. 💊
And page 11 today in the FT .

I have no idea if its going up or down.
If you think it's going up, buy the equity. But if income is your driver and you are confident that further declines have a floor,  then you could look to play this through a Barrier Reverse Convertible and take the coupons.

Marex issued Fixed coupon on Novo Nordisk, and its not complicated.

You receive quarterly income over a 3 year investment in GBP.

If at maturity the stock is lower than a defined amount then you are open to a loss of capital, like you would if you owned a stock.
60% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 40% or more.
65% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 35% or more.
70% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 30% or more.
75% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 25% or more.


Guaranteed Coupon p.a. achieved
10.95% with a 60% barrier
11.31% with a 65% barrier
11.64% with a 70% barrier
11.93% with a 75% barrier

Please ping me if you would like  to chat further. 😊
[24/04/2025, 12:29:07] Adam Clib: Just so you know - you can get coupons between 16.5% - 18.75% if you use the same underlying name (Novo) but with an “Autocall” attached. 👌👊. 
Please ping me if you would like to know more.  Not so complicated.
[24/04/2025, 12:31:53] ~ KC Shetty: Very useful Adam. Thank you. Are there min and max investment amounts ?

[24/04/2025, 13:07:26] ~ Simon Brewer: And from your other neighbour and friend of former guest Chris Wood, I'd add this.....S&P500 companies, are forecast to grow earnings by 10% in 2025 and 14% in 2026. That appears to equate to almost 20 times forward earnings. On almost every measure this is a market whose valuation seems unsustainable. The above indicates that the US stock market has not remotely discounted a recession. "Faites vos jeux" my friends. I know where I am not bullish!

I have no idea if its going up or down.
If you think it's going up, buy the equity. But if income is your driver and you are confident that further declines have a floor,  then you could look to play this through a Barrier Reverse Convertible and take the coupons.

Same principal as the Novo idea above.

You receive quarterly income over a 3 year investment in GBP.

If at maturity the stock is lower than a defined amount then you are open to a loss of capital, like you would if you owned a stock.

75% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 25% or more.


Guaranteed Coupon p.a. achieved
16.90% with a 60% barrier
17.16% with a 65% barrier
17.39% with a 70% barrier
17.57% with a 75% barrier

I post this to highlight what coupons can be achieved, but as always you need to know and be confident in the underlying's.
With an autocall - even higher coupons.

Food for thought and no more today 😊, but if you want me to check some names....Ping me, no problem.
[24/04/2025, 14:15:34] ~ Simon Brewer: Hi Simon,
I listened to the latest podcast in the gym this morning and thought it was excellent. Carson came across very well and it was nice to hear be able to discover the voice behind Muddy Waters. I particularly liked his comments on passive investing. I have always seen it as the ultimate momentum trade and dislike it as such but he made me think of it and the associated risks more deeply. When the piper is finally paid, passive investing will be one of the weapons of mass destruction. I thought it was one of your best interviews. Perceptive, concise and good questions and again you left your guest the space to answer properly. Well done.
My trip to the US exposed me to the full horror of what those living there have to endure on a daily basis and that is all Trump all of the time. The cable news networks are relentless, dramatising everything and as polarising as anything I have seen. There seems to be no middle ground. Being assailed by that every day and knowing it will go one for the next 4 years must be terrible!
The Dems are simply nowhere at the moment. The only ones drawing any crowds are Bernie Saunders and AOC and their progressive message won’t wash with most Americans. It is only by stepping back, understanding why Trump won and moving closer to the centre that they have a hope of winning in 2028 or even winning one or both houses  in the midterms. 
While most of the people we saw lean Democrat, I did have lunch with an old New York friend who is a Trump supporter. Most of the country applauds the success of Trump’s immigration policies which have slowed the flow of migrants to a trickle. Most are fully behind the efforts to cut the size of the Federal government and also support the attempt to revive the industrial heartland. It means that Trump’s base will absorb quite a bit of pain before they turn  against him. That said, it was not his base that got him into power. It was the swing voters. They are not happy about the tariffs, are uncomfortable about Trump’s treatment of Ukraine and are embarrassed about the way this administration has gone after former allies. They particularly dislike the treatment of Canada and also the policy chaos.
While the tariffs have some logic a rebirth of the industrial heartland of America is a pipe dream in my opinion. Apart from anything else the US does not have the labour force to do the work. Manufacturing processes require precise work and as a result random drug tests. Given the gales of cannabis we often found ourselves walking through in both New Orleans and New York I wonder how many people would pass the tests!
Policy in our entire working lives has favoured capital over labour. Trump was brought to power by labour. In fact the last 3 US elections were won by the blue collar workers. There is therefore significant political logic behind the tariffs or at least their goals. Trump will never win the approval or votes of most of those with capital and he knows it so I expect him to double down in supporting his base. His addiction to conflict and the limelight will mean we have many more headline statements from him to come. I just hope the markets learn to react a little more equably than they have done recently!
For me, the big risk to global markets has always been the size of government debt amassed by so many nations. With democracy ill equipped to elect politicians who will make hard choices, it will be left to the markets and the bond market in particular to exercise control. We have seen them do that over the last few weeks though the most recent softening of stance in the tariffs was also probably also encouraged by the visit to the White House of the CEO’s of Walmart, Home Depot and Target. These guys warned Trump imminent rises and the possibility empty shelves as the tariffs impact is felt. Given these are the most used retailers for the MAGA crowd it was probably quite persuasive!
I am comforted that there is at least an adult in the room even if it is Mr Market but less bullish than I was. I think the earnings outlook in Europe is not bad and the valuations this side of the Atlantic are far more attractive. The Ukraine war seems to be in its endgame, however distasteful that will be, and that should result in lower energy prices, higher defence spending and higher spending on  infrastructure. So, while I am not betting against the US, I am trimming my overweight position on strong days and putting more money in Europe.
Well done on your enthusiasm for gold. I am afraid I cannot get the comments Buffett made about gold in his 2011 annual letter out of my head so I have not been able to enjoy the ride.
Best
Tyrrell

What we continue to see however is these larger mines eg Paladin / Fission / Deep Yellow - all delaying production or missing guidance. Uranium mining is hard! ‎<This message was edited>

[24/04/2025, 15:53:50] ~ Ben Finegold: It basically says current spot prices are too low to incentivise new production which for Deep Yellow is $80/lb. We’re basically back to the same argument as 2019 where spot prices are below the marginal cost of production for miners. Very limited downside from here we think and a bit of a value trade in the commodity space.

[24/04/2025, 23:22:42] Nick finegold: It’s a generational call , I think Tesla might go up 10-15% tomorrow as people figure out it’s the biggest defence contractor in the world , and will make drones controlled by his satellites . That’s why he said on the call ( which made no sense to me at all ) that Tesla would be 5x bigger than any company on earth . Robot army , drones . Flying cars controlled by ai . ‎<This message was edited>

[25/04/2025, 06:21:37] Nick finegold: He is actually the best analyst in the world because this is a not standard investment banking research .

[25/04/2025, 08:22:55] Nick finegold: It’s confusing for good reasons . No one gets this stocks that right except those that hold it for the long term . As a car company it’s never been worth its valuation still isn’t never has been and never will be . 

In alpha capture systems it’s the stock people get wrong the most in both directions both bulls and bears . 


When I got off the Tesla call I thought it should be a zero. Today I see it as the biggest defence and mobility company in world manufacturing drones , flying taxis , controlled by ai and satellites , robot armies . Etc etc . 

It’s mad , because he is mad , but if you were short Tesla and saw that video it would question your belief system , especially if US retail falls hard for the next leg of the story .
[25/04/2025, 08:37:41] ~ Seth: If you are excited about physical AI, drones and humanoids - need to look at the Rare Earth Magnet supply chain.  MP Materials is the best, most liquid play.

[25/04/2025, 08:43:31] ~ Seth: Well, they've stopped sending it.  They have also stood up a magnet plant in Dallas Fort Worth.  Can process 1kt of refined rare earth there, going to 3kt.   But they mine 16kt.  They have offtake with 3 of the top 10 auto OEM's.  Suspect frame agreement with Tesla and a govt investment on the short term horizon to ramp Dallas to closer to 16kt.  Govt subsidy is already $30/kg.  At 16kt that would be nearly $500m/annum alone (excluding sales proceeds and refining mark up) and that is a Trump program - mkt cap 4.2bn. ‎<This message was edited>

[25/04/2025, 08:49:18] ~ Seth: Model is tricky right now, as they are building inventory while they ramp refining and magnet plant (because they're no longer shipping to China).  But from '26 things get clearer.  Suspect frame agreement with major offtaker might fund that working cap.  We have them getting to $600m of EBITDA by 27, still well below 16kt of magnet production.  BUt there is upside in the mining biz too.  There's also M&A angle - Australia's richest mining family took a stake last year, as well as in Lynas (the other scaled non Chinese player) and tried to put them together.  She is friends with Trump.
[25/04/2025, 10:08:49] ~ Julie: PB Fintech created PB Healthcare earlier this year in a bold and innovative move  into healthcare infrastructure that aims to disrupt the sector, drive down costs and ultimately make healthcare cover more affordable.

Yesterday it announced an investment of $63m as part of a $171m funding round that will see its stake fall from 100% to 32.14% and the HMO move beyond concept. All of which is in line with plans previously flagged by the company.

[25/04/2025, 12:30:44] ~ Andrew Draycott: I’m probably not qualified to give a view on the politics, but the last incident with Pulwama in 2019 was equally fraught, and clearly made emotions run high. From a financial markets perspective it was a good entry point, and respectfully Pakistan is effectively a failed state. The military might of India, means it would be relative madness for this to escalate from a Pakistan perspective. Markets were a little down today, but my fund is up 5% ytd in dollars so I attribute it more to having been a solid outperformer than anything more sinister. Obviously stand to be corrected by far more connected minds on here

[25/04/2025, 16:40:07] ~ Matt H: What is stopping the Chinese taking Tesla’s vision, copying it and making it better and cheaper? When you have a government that directs its companies to become the best they go out secure everything needed in the supply chain starting with the minerals, processing technology etc. While Elon can get a ridiculous valuation for his companies which secures the capital to make his vision a reality he can’t compete with the Chinese government.
[25/04/2025, 16:47:17] Nick finegold: No doubt it’s an arms race . But that’s true of ai , chips and everything . 

I repeat what Elon said on the call . “If we execute Tesla will be as valuable as the next 5 biggest companies in the US put together . “ what Jonas did last night is explain clearly why that’s not a total fantasy by piecing together all the different assets and explaining what that will look like . 

Whether it’s true of not isn’t really the point it’s whether the American public believe it . If they do the fund managers don’t really have a choice about ownership . That how we got we are and that’s how we will get where we are going .Let’s not over intellectualise it, it’s traumatising as the act company is not worth anything like the market cap we all know that .

The dream was to create millions of electric cars and charging points and put thousands of satellites into space . Not sure many want to short his next dream . Tough one because it breaks all the rules , but sometimes you get the company and then market cap and other times you get the market cap and then the company . Amazon was similar , ridiculous market cap and no profits for 20 years . Then it changed .

“I asked Elon Musk a follow up about China's leadership in the drone market. 

To which he quoted a friend of his who said: 

"...any country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doomed to be the vassal state of any country that can. And we can't – America cannot currently manufacture its own drones. Let that sink in." 

In our opinion, America’s lack of software defined/AI adjacent manufacturing expertise is sure to become a very topical and exciting investment theme in the quarters ahead.

Rick Smith

Got it. Let me maybe take this one. So, yes, I mean, Dedrone has sold a lot of stuff in Ukraine, but the far bigger picture is what happened in Ukraine has put drones on everybody's road map. Every military in the world is thinking about how do you detect these small drones that traditional military systems are not designed to detect, how do you defend against them. We acquired the world leader in drone detection. We acquired the at least one of the world leaders in indoor tactical drones with Skydio. We've partnered with the leading US maker of long range autonomous AI driven drones, in the moment where, basically DJI is largely being made illegal in the United States. So we think we are in an amazing position for drones and robotics. It's an area we're investing heavily. We're currently either the leader or partnered with the leader in the key market segments. And when you think about things like patrolling borders, protecting stadiums, and, I mean, Ukraine has shown what anybody could do with a drone you can buy for less than $500 and everybody in the world is thinking about how to defend against those, and we think we are, if not the best positioned, among the best positioned, for helping our customers globally solve that problem. So from a human perspective, I certainly hope that all the violence we're seeing in the world, comes to an end, but in a way that is persistent and sort of long-term puts these issues to rest. And we look forward to playing a role in helping use technology to protect people from killer drones. We're not going to get into the lethal drone business ourselves, but we're going to absolutely be a leader in helping defend against those kinds of threats and then using drones to be able to go out, act more intelligently, save lives, and stop threats without using lethal force. And we think those opportunities have all gotten bigger, just given the quick evolution of the space that's been caused by what's been happening in the Middle East and in Ukraine.

And, Rick, I might just add one more thing there, which is just, to the first part of your question, Jeremy, just to address any ambiguity. None of our forward-looking guidance assumes any incremental revenue from Ukraine.

[26/04/2025, 13:13:57] ~ Rich McDonald: ChatGPT interpretation of the specific venue choice:
 
Why would world leaders be placed under this image for peace talks, with simple chairs and no table.
	•	Symbolism of Humility: Sitting in simple chairs — no table, no grandeur — echoes the humility of Christ being baptized. It strips away ego, status, and pride. The two leaders are just men, human beings facing each other, not kings, not gods.
	•	A Moment of Rebirth: Just as baptism signifies the death of the old self and the birth of the new, their meeting could symbolize the end of hostility and the beginning of peace — starting again, washed clean from the blood of war.
	•	Witnessed by the Divine: Above them, the painting shows heaven opening, the Holy Spirit descending like a dove. It frames their conversation as being not just between two politicians, but as being witnessed by a higher, moral force — justice, truth, mercy — asking them to rise above selfishness and war.
	•	The Absence of Material Barriers: No table between them means there’s no negotiation, no posturing — only vulnerability and honest dialogue. Two men facing each other with nothing between them but the burden of people’s suffering and the hope for redemption.

⸻

In short:
Placing two leaders under The Baptism of Christ in St. Peter’s Basilica would send the message:

“Here, in the holiest place, under the symbol of new life, humility, and forgiveness, you are called to set aside your pride and create peace.”

[28/04/2025, 12:57:29] Nick finegold: Brussels (CNN) — In an unprecedented wave of cyber assaults, critical infrastructure across Europe was targeted early Monday in what officials are calling one of the largest coordinated cyberattacks in history. European Union cybersecurity agencies have pointed to Russian state-backed groups as the primary suspects behind the widespread disruptions.

Power grids, financial institutions, airports, and healthcare systems across more than 15 countries were affected. Several major European banks reported temporary outages, and airports in Frankfurt, Paris, and Madrid experienced system failures that caused extensive flight delays. Emergency services in parts of Germany and Poland were forced to revert to analog communications after losing digital capabilities.

"This is a direct attack on European sovereignty," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a press briefing. "We will respond with unity, strength, and resilience."

The Kremlin has officially denied involvement, dismissing the accusations as "baseless and provocative."

At the same time, NATO forces reported unusual naval movements in the North Atlantic. According to U.S. European Command (EUCOM), at least six Russian naval vessels, including two destroyers and a submarine, were detected maneuvering near critical undersea cable routes between Europe and North America. Additional allied naval assets have been deployed in response to what a senior Pentagon official described as "a significant and deliberate show of force."

"This pattern of behavior is deeply concerning," said Admiral James Thornton, commander of NATO's Allied Maritime Command. "We are closely monitoring all maritime traffic and are prepared to safeguard transatlantic security."

The disarray of information and the creation of “smoke” makes me suspect that there was more than a technical fault. More questions than answers. On a day with a clear blue sky the network suddenly lost 60%+. It is being said due to unusual oscilation. The “severe atmosphics” story is rubbish. I was asked by a journo yesterday if it could have been a cyber attack and the answer is yes (we saw the Russians playing around in Ukraine 10 years ago - BlackEnergy). Was it a cyber attack? I dont know, but it worries me than the quasi-official press here is saying that the CNN article shown above “never existed” and earlier talk of a high level of port probing coming out of IPs from Morrocco is being dissed. Was this Russian signalling? Possible. And why on earth would seven ministers, VPs and the President himself relicate to the HQ of the network operator?  I suspect the real story might never emerge. But lets be clear about one thing: Spain has just lived a live fire practice.
[29/04/2025, 07:51:31] ~ Mark Lewis: Why would Russia make a cyber-attack on Spain and Portugal when it is the UK, France, and Germany that it really hates the most? It is the UK, France, and Germany that are the biggest cheerleaders for ongoing military confrontation with Russia.

Also it is classic Russian playbook - disparate signals in different places that are obviously deniable

Indians are now 12% of all mined gold and buying $60bn additional each year. If household savings grow at 8%, then you can assume that the 60bn will grow at that rate too

POWER OUTAGES: “ Congratulations to Spain on reaching Net Zero 25 years ahead of schedule.” 
I was just talking to someone who has spent 35+ years designing and building Energy infrastructure globally and has been trying but failing to advise Team Miliband here. In 5 minutes explaining simple physics and what is practical he dispelled 90% of the garagantuan garbage being spewed by the media today. “ Solar inverters lack rotational inertia, unlike traditional generators, risking faster frequency swings. 
This is serious growing risk for grid stability as renewables rise as a %? Nuclear base load power cant come quick enough…
This focussed me ever more on a reminder that “Just 4 kg of enriched uranium is enough to power a nuclear submarine for 30 years without refueling.” Think about opportunity..
LIGHTBRIDGE/ LTBR US CEO Seth Grae also reminds …

EMERGING MARKET “NEEDS”:  
VEON US ( old Vimpelcom) still cheapest US listed EM wireless play. Global footprint, with operations spanning Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan under brands such as Jazz, Kyivstar, Banglalink, and Beeline. 
To me Currencies remain key and this a great re-rating of EM currencies “ needs” play. Change and turmoil and likes of what is happening in Pakistan means $4 dollar ARPU’s not $2. A classic EM Consumer play. 
156m mobile subscribers, $2bn ebitda, lowest ARPU (avge revenue /user) in the mobile world and they will & can only grow from here, so constant currency growth of 20%+. Nothing else is valued <$100/ sub lets alone $200.
Nutstuff has owned for 3 yrs + but now feels huge “game on”.  Btw only 2 analysts neither I have ever heard of cover! ( NF needs some SHAREFLIX love). ‎<This message was edited>

[29/04/2025, 11:11:20] ~ Mark Lewis: You took the words right out of my mouth: 

”Nuclear baseload power can’t come quick enough.”

Exactly, that’s the whole problem with nuclear! 

It is always subject to massive time over-runs and massive cost over-runs (you forgot that bit in your increasingly tedious anti-renewables rant above).
[29/04/2025, 11:12:16] ~ Matt H: It’s the most expensive form of power.
[29/04/2025, 11:13:06] ~ Mark Lewis: Right! And by a (three) mile (island)
[29/04/2025, 11:20:13] ~ William Nutting: Mark. Apologies for my tedium. Its emphatically not blanket “anti - renewables”. Noone in their right mind can be ANTI renewables but with grid structure as it is right now it can only do a certain amount of the heavy lifting. Thats the point .
A simple look at how power is distributed around the UK made that even clearer to me. 
If you tell me we can have a new distributed alternative grid overlaid over or alongside the old one and full of batteries charged by wind wave etc then noone happier than me. I believe however people who know  much better than us ( well me anyway) and do power for a living that there is a massive issue here. Happy to be corrected and maybe our relentless pursuit of nuclear is just wrong.
[29/04/2025, 11:23:05] ~ Malcolm Offord: Today the UK has battery storage for half an hour peak usage. If we were to bring 100% of the world’s storage to the UK, we would have half a day’s peak usage
[29/04/2025, 12:32:01] ~ Mark Lewis: Fair enough, William, it’s just that I remember the CEOs of all the European utilities — but especially RWE — saying that wind and solar would *never* be commercial my viable. So they never invested in renewables until they had lost 80% of their market cap because renewables had crashed the power price.
[29/04/2025, 12:36:56] ~ Mark Lewis: And it’s the same discourse now only with battery storage. Costs will come down and it Will scale just as renewables did. 
In the meantime you build new gas to back up renewables — miles cheaper and quicker to build than nuclear and you don’t have to worry about the waste or insurance
[29/04/2025, 12:40:08] Adam Clib: So this was Highlighted yesterday: 
U.S SMALL CAPS (IWM) are underperforming the S&P 500 by the largest margin this century.

If you think that US  Small Cap indices bounces and you want gearing - please read on.

Two ways to play:
 
2 year note issued by Barclays, in USD , on the Russell 2000.  Capital at risk Participation note , 
If it goes down you are 1:1 in terms of downside
 
Version 1:
Gearing: x1.15 , so if its up 20% at maturity you get  23% return with no cap

Version 2
Gearing: x1.50 , so there is a cap on the underlying performance: +33.333%, if its up 20% at maturity you get 30% return.
The max redemption = 100% + 1.5*33.333% = 150%

Please ping me if I can assist further.

on a few other “live” ideas..

RWE: a core European Nutstuff “NEEDS” Utility holding. The above Is absolutely a wake-up call about the importance of Grid stability and Generation capacity. The newly appointed German Economy Minister is an executive from German utility E.on. Did anyone notice that?! (Tx Shrub). 


NOBLE DRILLING (NE): +9% pre. Solid results, with a massive +30% increase in backlog to $7.5bn. it Feels like we might have bottomed in Offshore.

SOFI: +10% , numbers absolutely confirm this story is 100% on track. 

HIMS US, remains a core name! HUGE  Wegovy news has stock +41%! 

CARDIOL/ CRDL US: this appointment is a very good validation! Ex CMO of Eli Lilly joins the board.

[29/04/2025, 14:23:55] ~ Mark Lewis: By the way, ask the German utilities how keen they are to build new nukes or even bring back the ones they are currently in the process of decommissioning. 

They have ZERO enthusiasm. Literally zero.

[29/04/2025, 14:51:47] Adam Clib: 💊Novo Nordisk is a name mentioned on here quite a lot. 💊



If you think it's going up, buy the equity. But if income is your driver and you are "confident that further declines have a floor",  then you could look to play this through a Barrier Reverse Convertible and take the coupons.

Marex issued Fixed coupon on Novo Nordisk. 

You receive quarterly income over a 3 year investment in GBP.

If at maturity the stock is lower than a defined amount then you are open to a loss of capital, like you would if you owned a stock.
60% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 40% or more.
65% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 35% or more.
70% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 30% or more.
75% barrier means you have downside if the stock falls 25% or more.


Guaranteed Coupon p.a. achieved
9.92% with a 60% barrier
10.31% with a 65% barrier
10.67% with a 70% barrier
10.98% with a 75% barrier

[29/04/2025, 14:53:27] Nick finegold: GM suspends call by 48 hours awaiting an announcement from Trump on auto tariffs ? 

In line result. 1Q results featured in line Adj. EBIT and modestly lower FCF conversion. Margins still strong by historic standards. China JV profit near break-even.
Withdrawn guidance. This is not at all a surprise given the uncertainty of tariff policies that could impact many billions of $ of Adj. EBIT depending on outcome and implementation. GM imports roughly 1mm units into the US from CN, MEX and Asia.
Suspended open market repo. Makes total sense to us given the fluidity of the situation which could entail OEMs such as GM consuming cash in many tariff and consumer scenarios.
Delayed conference call, President Trump in Detroit. While removing the guidance and suspending the buyback is not a shock, the delay in the conference call timing - if only by 48 hours - has grabbed investor attention. The delay seems to coincide with a Trump rally in the Detroit area after reports of U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying that President Trump is moving towards softening auto tariffs. While not confirmed, the President's visit to Macomb County (marking Trump's first 100 days in office) could present a unique opportunity for Trump to meet directly with the automakers, including GM. GM says the extra time should help offer a greater basis of information by which to address the forward outlook and market questions and that the management team is in direct communication with POTUS.

Totally unserious to quote him as an authority on energy-related matters (and people like MSW probably hated him when he was in office in any case so this is just another example of a highly confected and politically motivated attack on Net Zero). 

There us just no serious discussion of energy-climate topics in the mainstream UK media, it’s all just dishonest posturing for short-term political gain. 

Also, since when was MSW an energy journalist? Didn’t she used to write about real estate in the FT? 

And who in their right mind gets their views on energy from the Daily Mail in any case?
[29/04/2025, 19:17:22] ~ William Nutting: 1 trade deal just done..👍🏿 

For those who care:
MARIJUANA/ WEED: NF def worth getting GLASF engaged with The Collective..

“Its about Getting Well not getting high”. 
Nutstuff has pitched GLASF as an idea for 3yrs + and seeing the distinct lack of alpha until recently a slight mea culpa.  “Trumps not a weed fan”, well maybe so but RFK and an evergrowing strata of society get the opportunity of “Getting well…” 
On ways to invest in Cannabis its as I see it still : either MSOS US ETF and GLASF US ( by far and away the gold standard co.) but is $420m so maybe too small for most. MSOS ETF is tiny and full of cr@p. 
Charts on both are however wake up! 
Let's just see if new proposed cannabis legislation gets some momentum. The stocks are again however reacting. 
On conviction and patience, the cannabis space is another coiled spring. The longer the spring coils, the more energy should be released as the industry matures under overbearing regulation. 
Glass House Brands is my biggest exposure in the space and from end ‘23 entry has been beyond dull.  The underlying business is however on fire. Numbers due 13th May. 
As they grow; costs are lowest in industry; $100/lb and so operating cash flow really inflects higher (over the next 12m) and the company will have a handful of avenues it can progress down. Further if they pursue hemp production in the future, or we see more on legalisation and that elusive NYSE (most likely)  this could arguably become a $20-$30 stock in short order. ( tx Scott)

[29/04/2025, 22:25:41] ~ Dipesh Patel: SBUX - nothing too exciting IMO. Whether Niccols is delusional or not, time will tell, but he's narratively put as shiny a gloss on it as you'd expect, seeing so much more opportunity than ever and shifting from optimistic to confident. Margins would be a material alarm bell taking a huge hit, mostly investing in Back to Starbucks. Overall the EPS miss (c25%) is technically an earnings disappointment, but the bulls will want to look through that. It's always been an 18m call, so I continue to believe they will disappoint and that this is another decade dominating brand that is no longer what it was to the consumer. It's had a marked sell off into the numbers and probably trades sideways for a bit, a break of 75-80 level being material.

Q2 revenue rose 3% (constant currency) to $8.8B, despite a 1% drop in global same-store sales. U.S. sales fell 2%, but transaction volume improved. Operating margin shrank 450 bps due to labor and restructuring costs. EPS dropped to $0.41 from $0.69 on higher turnaround expenses.

[30/04/2025, 07:23:46] ~ Ben Finegold: Physical uranium is quietly going about a rebound with prices now moving higher 12 days in a row albeit in 10c - 50c increments.

One of the main industry consultants UxC noted in their weekly report that…

“Offer prices climbed each day over the past week as multiple utilities entered the market seeking near-term uranium.”

Since the trough on 4th April there has been a big move in uranium miners Cameco +29%, Paladin 34%, Encore 45%, Denison 23%, UEC 32% Centrus +30% and NexGen 29%. 

The sequesters Yellow Cake (+9%) and SPUT (+12%) are the underperformers. 

These names remain 20-50% off their 12 month highs. 

The term price is $80 lb has had one down month since September 2022. With spot at $67 we still have over 17% contango.

Reminder Cameco report tomorrow and are speaking to the club next week.
[30/04/2025, 07:32:32] ~ Dipesh Patel: Can't see anything wrong with Barclays. It's had a strong run but these nos and guidance continue to provide a huge opportunity IMO. +ve Jaws with op costs up only 5.5%, revs +11%. Raised guidance for 2025 with NII >12.5bn (ex IB/central). 2026 looks v strong guidance too (op profit £13bn). No delinquencies increase for both US/UK cards. IB +17% Q1 top end of the pack. I think they've been cautious on guidance as clearly a lot of room for upgrades but also a lot of global uncertainty. Running cost/income ratio 57% v 61 guidance. Only niggle is a small increase in US general provisions and the beat is just 8%. Core long for me.
[30/04/2025, 07:33:06] Nick finegold: It’s been a great call DP thankyou
[30/04/2025, 07:43:47] ~ Robin Maxwell: Two questions please Dipesh - 1) Is the US general prov increase linked a forecast increase in delinquencies? Or more corporate interest payment / inventory finance write-offs ? Or something else… 2) NII seems to be much higher than expected… is that right ? Are they forecasting flat NII into 2026? Do pref Barclays to UBS which I feel was too harshly treated by the market SFR 32 to 22 post liberation day but has not recovered to same extent and yet over time they both trade quite similarly - which makes sense to me. 🙏
[30/04/2025, 07:48:54] ~ Dipesh Patel: 1) The US provision increase is c64m tiny and general given changes in US/caution. 2) NII is higher and the flat forecast is just them being cautious in my view esp given upwards yield curve but they may feel the curve has been flat so prudent. They're doing 12-13bn op profit v mkt cap 42bn. Way too cheap  I feel
[30/04/2025, 08:19:17] Nick finegold: From the World Gold Council. 

Interesting to note Jewellery demand falling heavily as the price rises . I am thinking about Pandora which is a good company but might be struggling in this environment. 

Key Highlights
Inflows into global gold ETFs rocketed in Q1: demand of 226t was the strongest for three years. Investors across the globe bought gold as a refuge against the threat of trade wars, continued geopolitical strife and equity market turmoil. 
 
Global central banks bought 244t of gold in Q1. The pace of buying slowed, but remained well within the elevated quarterly range seen over the last three years.  
 
Investment in gold bars and coins remained elevated at 325t. Gold’s price momentum attracted investor interest, which was cemented by the political and economic volatility roiling global markets.
 
Gold jewellery consumption dropped 21% y/y as record prices impacted affordability. While tonnage demand was lower in virtually every market, the value measure of demand increased in every country except China. 
 
Total gold supply was 1% higher y/y  as mine production inched up to a Q1 record of 856t. This was offset by a 1% decline in recycling as consumers held onto their gold hoping for higher prices. ‎<This message was edited>

[30/04/2025, 10:18:10] ~ William Nutting: NUTSTUFF on positioning, stocks and Bitcoin.

FUND MANAGER POSITIONING: I thought this fascinating from ‘Strategas’: they just hosted a London Fund Manager dinner. “We were fortunate to be joined by an esteemed group of institutional clients and investors in
London for dinner last night. The table shaded modestly bearish equities / bullish bonds, with more than half of our roughly 25 guests believing that the next 10% move for the S&P was lower and the lows for the year had yet to be seen. Over 50% of the table thought the FOMC would wind up cutting 3 or more times this year, with 70% thinking they’ll go again in June. The table was bullish Gold and bullish rest of world vs. U.S.. Curiously, about 90% report they do not own any bitcoin personally.” 


STOCKS: SNAPCHAT, timewasting & favoured by many economically inactive people, -13% have an “advertising
issue” good I dislike intensely! STARBUCKS, more yeuch. Filthy coffee, people don’t come back, this is the worst of American exports; move on. By contrast; MARIJUANA names all on fire again yesterday (see below: “Get healthy not high”). SOFI US, great numbers, also see re-launching Digital asset trading (banned under Biden). HIMS US, a key Unicorn for Nutstuff, huge GLP1 distribution deal. On ‘Spec-sit’ CARDIOL/ CRDL US see
ex CMO of Eli Lilly joins the board, oh and VISA beats. OAKLEY CAPITAL/ OCI LN my Pvt Equity spec sit is still doing the numbers! An NAV of 707p (vs 457p) + 2.7% YoY (a simple testament to how good they are) Portfolio story is +ve: North Sails, Bright Stars and TechInsights vs “drag” of Time Out. Finally: Watch Uranium, I know its
been awful but as with Offshore Drillers (we own VALARIS & WFRD), never forget: “When everyone hates something it MAY go up, when everyone loves it MUST go down”. Have been some big moves in Centrus,

For those that have been members of the club for some time . This looks like it frees up
The metals company to deep sea mine for poly metallic nodules and get into production over the next 12 months or so. Big news stock is up 200% off its lows now . 


But could be 5-10x from here if things go well.  No doubt there will bumps in the road , but securing minerals is a priority and this maybe a way to play the game that’s currently below the radar for those with that type of risk appetite.

[02/05/2025, 10:28:30] ~ William Nutting: On a theme of new National champions and finding a non US name when before the default was US…

A NEW POSITION THIS WEEK: AVIO. IM is an Eur500m co and 30% owned by Leonardo (a Nutstuff Portfolio name). Avio is a key beneficiary of the European Rearmament, both in its Space division and its Defence Division.  Furthermore, the company is fundamentally cheap, with a strong backlog and in an important, strategic position.  This article frames the background of this call: https://www.wsj.com/finance/europe-defense-us-military-industrial-complex-61ea9654
In Defence etc just imagine if the US could immobilise Lockheed Martin fighter jets using a “Kill Switch”. Just imagine Denmark using Lockheed Martin fighter jets to defend Greenland and all the US has to do is press a button and they drop like flies. It serves as the prime contractor for the Vega rocket family and a key supplier for Ariane 6. Avio’s core expertise lies in developing and manufacturing solid rocket motors, which are used in both the Vega and Ariane boosters. A Fun fact: The Company originates from Fiat as early as 1908, and at some point it was owned by Private Equity and General Electric! European Defence Peers such as Leonardo trade on 12x fwd EBITDA but bellwether Rheinmetall trades as high as 19x EBITDA. The nearest US Peer in Space is Rocket Labs, which trades on 10x fwd SALES (it’s still EBITDA negative), though it’s a far more integrated player and its growth is not only launch-related.

[02/05/2025, 11:23:00] ~ GR: US Exceptionalism Cannot Be Killed Off By Trump

The most bullish argument in favour of the US has been made by the unlikeliest of people: Nouriel Roubini. His latest column on Project Syndicate goes completely against trend and argues US tailwinds are more than sufficient to overcome the tariff shock. He said even if Mickey Mouse were president, the US would still approach 4% growth. He said "America is the world leader in 10 of the 12 industries that will define the future, with China leading in only electric vehicles and other green tech". Tariffs don't change that, he said, and in fact the hyperscalers are doubling down on investment. Meanwhile, Roubini noted while former Italian PM’s Draghi and Letta have both written blue prints for European growth, European governments have largely ignored their recommendations. As for the threat from Trump, Roubini noted the president has lost in every game of chicken he's played. He backed down on reciprocal tariffs the moment the markets objected; he's had to request a meeting with China on tariffs; Trump blinked first in his argument with Fed Chair Powell.

The slowing consumer in the US raises the spectre of stagflation should all announced tariffs remain in place (unlikely IMHO). Equities will hate that scenario and yet we could get trade deals and war end in the meantime. Given the 2Q earnings report will be a general challenge - I would rather sell in late may or early june and go away. What used to take a year in politics could happen in the next month...and don't under-estimate the possibility of resurgent consumer confidence post election in Germany....should that happen they'll be another reason to Buy Europe.

[03/05/2025, 05:57:25] ~ William Nutting: Chris Wood addressed this..

ChrisW: The base case here remains that the US has no leverage over China on the tariff issue. Beijing has made it crystal clear that it will not cut tariffs unless the US makes the first move since it is the Trump administration which initiated this trade war. The plan of the Trump administration is obviously to seek to isolate China by agreeing trade deals with more friendly countries, such as Japan and India. If this pressure means Japan and India may be able to negotiate better deals with the US than might otherwise have been the case, they are unlikely to agree terms that threaten their trading relationship with China. Remember that China specifically warned last week that it will retaliate against any country that negotiates trade deals with America “at the expense of China’s interests”. In this respect, it is a reality that for many countries China is now a more important trade partner than the US. All of the above is why the Donald still badly needs an off-ramp before his tariff agenda inflicts too much unnecessary damage on the American economy, evidence of which is likely to show up in data in the next few weeks. Chris repeats the point that Trump should revert to a universal 10% tariff for everybody and then drop the rest of the agenda. From a stock market standpoint, the lack of evidence of accelerating stimulus deprives the China equity story of a near-term catalyst. Still Chris is comfortable with China equities both from a valuation standpoint, in a context where consumer sentiment appears to be stabilising at worst, and from a diversification standpoint since China is significantly uncorrelated to Wall Street-correlated global equities.  If the biggest potential positive catalyst for China equities, and indeed US equities, is a total Trump U-turn on tariffs, the biggest risk is a threatened Washington delisting of US-listed Chinese ADRs. Chris views this as extremely unlikely but clearly nothing is impossible.  Any such delisting action would be a massive buying opportunity for the rest of the world including European investors who, in his view, will not follow the US in the context of the current Trump administration.
[03/05/2025, 06:04:50] ~ Andrew Draycott: I read that piece, and imho he is wrong on India putting any precedent to China over the US in trading relations. The FM was unequivocally hawkish China dumping via third party countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh and was seeking to impose tariff barriers to prevent it. India sees the bilateral agreement with the US as a generational opportunity to take manufacturing share from 1% to something like their services share at 8%, and will bend over backwards to give the US what they want in order to achieve it. Chinese fdi into India has consistently been banned, and byd recently tried to invest $10bn into Hyderabad and were stopped. Tik tock and Chinese tech is also banned. There is zero leverage for China over India, and I don’t really understand where Chris perceives it to lie.
[03/05/2025, 06:05:18] ~ Dipesh Patel: 💯.  In any case, any forced delisting will just escalate the issues with China that will just say OK no Apple, Tesla or any US companies in China due to security concerns. US companies will scream and Trump would have to backtrack. Again, nothing is impossible with this administration, but it's not a wise move for the US to escalate to that level as that ball will end up back up US's court. You can of course own HK listed main players and not ADRs for those wanting the China exposure still.
[03/05/2025, 06:22:09] ~ Dipesh Patel: I think overall the ROW would not want to cease trading ties with the size of China including India ultimately, which usually sits in the middle on almost every geopolitical issue. India may smell the opportunity which would be the issue re China. Already, China containers freighted into US have collapsed while March Indian container shipments to US were +35% preloading ahead of tariffs. So India might break rank agreed, but ultimately in the long term they should want to trade openly with a population way bigger than US
[03/05/2025, 06:23:34] ~ Robin Maxwell: Friends of mine tell me he is investing billions in Africa… Ecotourism / hotels / infrastructure… friend referenced Kenya but I understood Bezos not only US billionaire trying to compete with Chinese money on African soil.
[03/05/2025, 06:33:03] ~ Andrew Draycott: The reason I don’t agree is that China is 30% of global manufacturing and India is 1%. India wants that market as it has remained elusive up until now with Apple moving from zero to 20% of iPhone production in 4 years. Labour costs are one fifth of China’s, yet China have been incredibly protectionist of their own consumption, hence their huge cad surplus over the years with nearly all countries (bar commodity exporters). If you can only buy off China and not sell in, where is the trade benefit? Amazon were banned, Google were banned, Phillip Morris banned. I’m not sure the carrot of Chinese consumption unless you are lvmh is really one that India can capitalise on. Time will tell
[03/05/2025, 06:38:31] ~ Dipesh Patel: Fair. I also just think they need the goods like everyone does. A lot of components that go on to then be used in other things that India will make. India imports more from China than it sells to US. It will still need those goods 🤷🏽‍♂️

[05/05/2025, 16:56:20] ~ Matt H: Gold prices surged to record highs in the first quarter of 2025, as macroeconomic and geopolitical forces reshaped investor sentiment. The metal’s traditional role as a safe haven has been reinforced amid growing unease over U.S. trade policies, which have strained U.S. relations with the world and eroded confidence in the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.
Fueling the rally further is sustained demand from China’s central bank, which has steadily increased its gold reserves in a bid to diversify away from dollar-denominated assets. This strategic shift highlights a broader realignment in global asset allocation, particularly among emerging market economies.
Adding further momentum is a forthcoming change in U.S. banking regulation. From July 2025, gold will be reclassified as a Tier 1 capital asset under Basel III rules — aligning U.S. standards with global norms. Because gold will now be a Tier 1 capital asset, banks can operate with far less capital than when gold was classified as Tier 3. Under the new regulations, allocated (physical) gold will have zero risk weighting. This could significantly impact the gold market, driving up prices and contributing to the overall demand for gold.
[05/05/2025, 16:57:04] ~ Matt H: The interesting bit is Basel III rule changes from July 1st

[05/05/2025, 17:03:24] Nick finegold: If you all want to know the real reason Gold is rallying   its because I sold long position in IG index last week.  This is the best indicator that has ever been invented and never reported on in FT . It has a 100% accuracy rating .

[05/05/2025, 21:31:48] ~ William Nutting: (Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. described rising demand for artificial intelligence software as a “ravenous whirlwind” in a letter to shareholders Monday, as the company raised its full-year revenue forecast and reported quarterly sales that beat analyst estimates.  Sales will be about $3.9 billion in 2025, the Denver-based software company said Monday in a statement. That represents growth of about 36% from last year, and exceeds its previous guidance of a 31% increase.
[05/05/2025, 21:37:45] Nick finegold: David if I suggested that the President has no idea how any of this works, so why should we , I think that would be a fair ? every tariff he has announced in every industry where he has announced it , he had no clue of the complexity of the supply chain and I don’t think film is any different , which is your point .

[06/05/2025, 09:00:18] ~ William Nutting: 4 things of Interest: 

HIMS numbers last night reinforce again absolutely as a must own IMHO.  $9.3bn mkt cap. putting up Peak ‘23 Nvidia type growth. Guiding to $6.5bn in sales in 2030 with 20% ebitda margins. FCF + 321% / Net income + 345%. 

PALANTIR I just cannot own, as at a daft valuation for essentially a consultancy. 

GOOGL vs OPEN AI. ( Dr Windsor talks great sense) 

CROX vs SKX, I think this is really interesting.
CROCS/ CROX US:  Report this week.  CROX looks super cheap with Skechers SKX being bought out at 30% premium putting valuation closer to 12X EBITDA with Crocs at 6.6X. CROX EBITDA margins are 2X those of SKX. CROX is also well-diversified outside China for production unlike HEYDUDE their “problem” aquisition which is 95% China based. Skechers was bought by 3G for 15x PE / 28x ev/ ebitda. @ $63/shr. which is a few dollars above where it stood on Apr 2nd (and below its Jan high of $78). 40% of their product comes from China, and mngmt. had no clue what the back half of the year might look like. It's important that: 
A) Skechers was worried enough to take the cash.
B) Private Equity was there to offer a bid. Skechers was looking at reporting for the next 9 months having no idea what the numbers would be. After a quarter century of printing solid returns for shareholders the certainty of an offer beat the chaos of the moment. Skechers went public in 1999 and is selling out fairly close to all-time highs.

[06/05/2025, 15:44:32] ~ Jonny Haycock: Anecdote. 40 family offices attended my VG lunch on gold in Beverly Hills yesterday. Out of 40, only 3 had any form of allocation to gold. And of those 3 all had less than 1% allocation. And held in a bank. Nobody thinking about gold as money. Few thinking sbout currency debasement, few realised that gold had o/performed S&P over last 25 yrs, all seemed unaware of the new Basel 3 rules re gold as tier 1 asset coming on July 1st. My conviction couldn’t be higher that the acceleration phase in gold/precious metals is ahead of us as the institutional/FO world seem totally unprepared for any form of monetary system reset.

If Gene sequencing can become democratised then Larry can gene sequence entire populations and store the data privately in the Orcale cloud .  

This is is the exact mechanism that Microsoft used to get into bed with LSEG . It was a cloud deal originally . MSFT bought a stake in LSEG in return for tiing up their cloud storage. Ai happened after the deal was struck . 

That’s my personal theory . ‎<This message was edited>

In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping. The Sultanate of Oman expresses its gratitude to both parties for their constructive approach that led to this welcome outcome, and hopes that it will lead to further progress on many regional issues towards achieving justice, peace, and prosperity for all.

[07/05/2025, 08:22:38] ~ Andrew Draycott: Goes back to the war of independence for Bangladesh and Russia parking a nuclear fleet in the Bay of Bengal to stop the Americans participating. It’s also why India would not join international sanctions against Russia, and 40% of installed military hardware is soviet. India spends $70bn on defence, Pakistan $6bn. We have had multiple skirmishes - the last being a pilot held hostage in 2019; I have an inherent bias, but there is absolutely nothing cyclical about the 80bn of domestic savings going into the Indian equity market each year. Foreign money has almost become irrelevant (will send the graph).  Personally I would suggest if it sells off (my portfolio is up today) - then use it to buy. In the 7 years I’ve run an Indian fund, these events are typically the only chance you get to get set.

CFO Luka Mucic has been poached by Vonovia. He has been a huge part of the turnaround strategy, and will be a loss.
However, is this a sign that the turnaround in Germany is failing?

I’ve been a bull of Vods because of the sheer size of the buyback + divi, however this leads me to suspect JPM may have something with their “Sell” rating from last week and 62p price target (Currently 72p).
[07/05/2025, 08:44:39] Nick finegold: BT also weak today although I am not sure why.
[07/05/2025, 08:47:41] ~ Andrew Draycott: Of the ones in India, they are tricky to buy without local accounts, but I am very bullish quick commerce (12 minute deliveries) with Swiggy currently on exceptional valuation with a huge cash balance sheet. India hotels (Taj group) has sold off and will double its revenue by 2030; an e-commerce logistics company called delhivery is also incredibly cheap and just cleaned out the number 2 player for 25% of its own valuation (again huge net cash balance sheet). Avoid all IT services as AI is going to disaggregate them, and stick to domestic consumption. Diageo subsidiary United Spirits should benefit from lower tariffs on scotch long term (Indians drink more whiskey by volume than any country and Diageo have 60% share). For a $13bn mkt cap you get the Indian whiskey market, the equivalent in China in kweichow moutai which has a $270bn mkt cap and is 15 years down the same path.

[07/05/2025, 08:58:13] ~ Andrew Draycott: It depends on the category- but I own ABB and Bosch local subsidiaries on the capex theme which is growing at double nominal gdp (although slower this year). Long term it’s a no brainer. The consumer FMCG companies like Unilever and Nestle are hideously overvalued as they are largely penetrated (Indians now consume toothpaste and washing detergents at western levels) so single digit volume growth for mid 50s PERs is absurd. They have negative dollar returns now for 3 years and I expect them to go the way of Unilever Indonesia over time (50x to 15x). Quick commerce is also white labelling goods which to price conscious consumer is very appealing
[07/05/2025, 08:58:57] ~ Robin Maxwell: Seems that the April FDA application for their own Pill and the idea that now they have supply to meet demand there will be more supply from Novo vs Generic copies which I understand were allowed to meet any supply gap (someone correct me if I am wrong on that)

[08/05/2025, 17:04:27] ~ Andrew Draycott: We hosted a call with Col. (Retd.) Ajai Shukla to take stock of the evolving India/Pakistan conflict.
The situation is tense, but not out of control. De-escalation remains on the table—if both sides can find and take a mutually acceptable off-ramp. History shows this can happen with our without international mediation. Cross-border attacks—explosions, drones, and power outages—have caused suffering and loss on both sides, including reports of India losing a fighter jet. But a full-scale war between two nuclear-armed nations (sorry to bore you with the cliché) is not possible—and if it does break out, conventional military strength (where India is far far superior) becomes irrelevant. That’s exactly why the U.S. has never gone to war with North Korea.

 
Executive Summary and the De-escalation Path?
Operation Ongoing: Operation Sindoor is still active, with reports of continued strikes. It won’t be considered over until there’s a formal announcement—and Pakistan agrees. In today’s social media era, there’s a political narrative at play, a military execution underway, and a diplomatic route being quietly explored.
No Full-Scale War (Yet): While there have been cross-border actions, both sides seem to be carefully balancing force with diplomacy. India appears to have a tactical advantage, but neither side is pushing toward full-blown conflict.
Backchannels Are Open: Dialogue is likely happening behind the scenes—through official channels or via third countries. For two nuclear-armed nations, these quiet lines of communication are critical.
Off-Ramp Available: A face-saving off-ramp exists if both sides can claim a win and step back. We’ve seen this before—like in 2019 when an Indian pilot was returned, helping end the standoff in a day. A similar move could defuse the current tension.
The Rafale??: Col. Shukla believes at least one fighter jet may have been lost. India hasn’t acknowledged it—probably to avoid giving Pakistan a narrative win. But interestingly, confirming it could serve as a circuit breaker for de-escalation.

Pakistan’s Political Landscape

Strategic Backdrop: The widening gap between India and Pakistan in economic, technological, and social spheres is fueling insecurity in Islamabad. Ironically, this imbalance may drive more hostility, not less—rooted in envy and pride. Pakistan is likely to stick with its reactive stance. India, meanwhile, must find a way to bypass the “Pakistan drag” and push ahead—"with or without us" remains a relevant doctrine. The current tit-for-tat strikes across borders serve no long-term strategic purpose.
Military Leadership: Former Army Chief Gen. Qamar Bajwa had a broader strategic outlook and questioned the utility of symbolic wins like "moral dominance." His successor, Gen. Munir, is seen as the opposite—reactive, grievance-driven, and lacking strategic depth. His intelligence chief (DGISI) is cut from the same cloth.
The Sharif Brothers: Neither Nawaz nor Shahbaz is in the military’s favor. Nawaz often clashed with the generals despite initially being their chosen candidate. Shahbaz maintained a transactional relationship with the army—largely to protect business interests—but doesn’t enjoy full trust either.
International Response

Global Mood: Since the Pahalgam incident, India has moved swiftly to engage key global players. Western democracies seem fatigued with Pakistan and more aligned with India’s strategic outlook. Pakistan’s overdependence on China and its historical flirtation with political Islam are now global liabilities. Islamabad is increasingly isolated, relying mainly on China, Turkey, and a lukewarm Saudi Arabia.
Russia’s Role: Russia’s balancing act is becoming harder as China asserts dominance in Asia. The traditional India-Russia comfort zone is being reshaped into a tense China-Russia-India triangle. Putin’s tilt depends on how much he needs Beijing’s backing against the West. India is trying to reassure Russia that growing U.S. ties aren’t at Moscow’s expense, but that’s a tough sell. For now, Russia—like the U.S.—has stayed neutral, calling only for de-escalation. It’s a tricky space for Indian diplomacy.
Indian Defence Performance

How has Indian equipment fared: There’s been little direct hardware-to-hardware clash, especially with Chinese systems. Most of India’s strike capability—tanks, APCs, S-400s, submarines—still comes from Russia. But India shines where it’s built for itself: indigenous missiles like the Agni series and domestically built warships (frigates, destroyers, corvettes) reflect real capability. Where India has relied on imports, it’s sacrificed tech control and slowed down true self-reliance.

Key takeaways from this week’s events in India-Pakistan for me: 1) entry point into a country set to benefit from the structural shift in world order (ex their IT companies as you mentioned earlier); and 2) boarder skirmishes globally will continue with this structural shift and heightened multipolarity.

“We expect subscription and services revenue to be between $600 million and $680 million. We expect to see stablecoin revenue growth. However, the main driver of the expected sequential decline is due to Ethereum and Solana prices, which are down approximately 36% and 25%, respectively, so far in Q2 compared to their Q1 averages. These price declines impact our blockchain rewards and other subscription and services revenue lines.”

[09/05/2025, 13:41:48] Nick finegold: The two words are “disease modification . “

[09/05/2025, 13:42:12] Nick finegold: Here’s the answer .
[09/05/2025, 13:43:39] Nick finegold: What does disease modification mean in plain English . 

Courtesy of ChatGPT

It strike me that below is the Meira GTX story in a nutshell. 

It is  a genetic disease modification platform ! 

Disease modification means you’re not just treating the symptoms — you’re actually slowing down or changing the course of the disease itself. In their case using genetics. 

In plain English:
Most Parkinson’s drugs are like painkillers — they make you feel better, but the disease keeps getting worse in the background.
A disease-modifying treatment aims to stop or delay the damage from happening in the first place. It’s closer to a fix than a patch. ‎<This message was edited>
[09/05/2025, 13:45:21] Nick finegold: In other words MeiraGTx is attempting to cure not treat the symptoms of disease. 

They have already helped blind children see again and now MIGHT have a cure for Parkinson’s . Hence the FDA’s heightened interest .
[09/05/2025, 13:48:10] Nick finegold: This is why both J&J and Sandi sit along side Schmidt and HoloLens on the share register . 

I ain’t a scientist , but if it’s good enough for them it’s good enough for me ‎<This message was edited>

[09/05/2025, 14:32:05] Nick finegold: I think that there coms needs a major overhaul , and that this like many of their announcements could be easily overlooked unless you really understand the meaning of disease modification which most won’t . But if I have this right they are close to two full cures , one for certain types of genetically induced child blindness and one for Parkinson’s. 

The JV with HoloLens could be a game changer . 

Gates recently said he hoped he could irradiate 5 diseases before he closes the foundation and spent the $200bn . Their approach has vast potential and it feels like we are getting close to money time.

Adds Strategic Interest in Tier-One Juanicipio Silver Mine and Significantly Strengthens its Silver Portfolio

Vancouver, British Columbia, May 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE: PAAS) (TSX: PAAS) ("Pan American") and MAG Silver Corp. (NYSEAM:MAG) (TSX:MAG) ("MAG") are pleased to announce that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Pan American will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of MAG pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the "Transaction"). MAG is a tier-one primary silver mining company through its 44% joint venture interest in the large-scale, high-grade Juanicipio mine, operated by Fresnillo plc ("Fresnillo"), who holds the remaining 56% interest in the Juanicipio joint venture.

Under the terms of the Transaction, MAG shareholders will receive total consideration of approximately $2.1 billion representing $20.54 per MAG share, based on the closing price of Pan American’s common shares on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on May 9, 2025. Consideration will be comprised of a mix of cash totaling $500 million and 0.755 Pan American shares per MAG share, subject to proration as detailed below. The consideration represents premiums of approximately 21% and 27%, respectively, on a prorated basis to the closing price and the 20-day volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of MAG’s common shares on the NYSE American ("NYSEAM") ending May 9, 2025. Following completion of the Transaction, existing MAG shareholders will own approximately 14% of Pan American shares on a fully diluted basis, benefiting from participation in a larger, diversified, and growth-oriented silver and gold producer.
[12/05/2025, 07:52:41] Nick finegold: Chinese takeaway - 


The question in my mind is whether this is Trump bump 2 and whether the damage has been done and represents a great selling opportunity. 

Global trade will slow , interest rates will fall and we have a range bound market that slides and then bounces due to potential interest rate cuts. Not sure but I can’t help but feel we are near the top of the range after the recent rally .

This is something the industry has fought fiercely in the past. It’s not clear whether the order will apply to all government purchases (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) or just some (Medicaid) and it is likely to encounter a lot of legal and political opposition, but the move is aggressive and negative for the pharma/biotech industry (stocks like Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, etc., are down several percent in Europe).

[12/05/2025, 10:20:01] ~ Andrew Draycott: Have just been listening to Mr Devasher national security advisory board member (former) for India. Ceasefire is in place but the government of India have stated two things that have serious implications for future relations.
1. Any terror act will be immediately seen as an act of war and retaliated against in the same way as an invasion.
2. ⁠the Indus water treaty won’t be reinstated, and they will not share dates on release of water leading to significant consequences to farming in Pakistan.

The second point here is to exert maximum pressure to stop terror networks operating in Pakistan with pseudo state support. It will sadly (in my view) lead to significant food shortages across Pakistan. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/05/2025, 22:16:56] Nick finegold: And Novo is being smashed because new US regs are trying to drop the price and reduce Medicare spending which is perfectly sensible.

However , Once again my pea sized brain thinks that if you can reduce cancer rates you would probably want to give these drugs to everyone , because that’s how you would really save money . By stopping people getting ill ! ‎<This message was edited>
[12/05/2025, 22:20:13] ~ M B: A significant % of healthcare spend is accounted for by inpatient costs versus drugs/doctors fees etc. I haven’t seen latest figures but historically total drug spend accounted for less than 15% of total healthcare spend.
[12/05/2025, 22:22:36] Nick finegold: Two words 

“Preventative maintenance. “ reduces costs .  I’m going to order some Ozempic next week because I am long Novo .

[12/05/2025, 22:40:31] Nick finegold: Everything I hate in a single stock . Nuscale is an absolute shit show . 

If they are on time , they might have their first reactor 203O in 2039 . They have An atm facility causing on going dilution , an unproven technology and a $5bn market cap . 

Who said building nuclear reactors was a good business anyway ?  Even if they are just designing them . Terra power have been at this 15 years  and are t really motivated by commercial gain . They want to  decarbonise the planet so may give all their tech away for free ? Just a thought . I think this is a shitty business .

[13/05/2025, 08:56:55] ~ Chris Huggins: I enjoyed this podcast with Simon and Peter Davies - thanks Simon!

One thing that slipped out half way through from Peter was a statement that Raspberry Pi could become one of the largest companies in the world due to it having a lead in “edge computing” and their importance in robotics.

£1bln market cap, but 42x earnings. 

Interested to know if any other views on them

[13/05/2025, 09:07:52] ~ William Nutting: Chris I think any talk of a PE rating on something like Rasberry Pi at this stage in its genus probably misses the point of where this might go T.A.M and architecture. Disruptive yet enabling, low cost. This is WEB 3.0 on steroids. Arguably if it stopped reporting any “e” it might be a sign that they see more opportunities for ROCE..
RP dovetails incredibly well with so much that is going on on “the new railroad of blockchain” driving fundamental behavioural change.
[13/05/2025, 09:09:25] ~ Chris Huggins: Very fair. 

In most private tech firms if you’re profitable then you’re considered ex-growth.

I will admonish myself and add some!

Well maybe its overly simple to say but now arguably every fund, every pension & 401(k) will all be inadvertently buying Bitcoin or the platform that helps you to buy it. Its simply just yet more wider adoption…

[13/05/2025, 11:34:24] ~ Tim: I was told a story by a professor at my MBA. He was working at Wyeth when Pfizer took them over in 2009. They had made good progress on a cancer vaccine... but Pfizer killed the program immediately after takeover.

It is much more lucrative for pharma to treat than prevent. 

I was a big pharma and medtech investor for 8 years so sadly seen this truism many times.
[13/05/2025, 11:38:07] Nick finegold: I think that ai is in time going to change that scenario quite substantially
[13/05/2025, 13:38:45] ~ JB: UNH

Call was just 20mins. 
Old CEO has taken over from Witty post his resignation.  

FY 25 guidance pulled less than 1 month after 1st warning. 

Witty has been paid $140m between 2018-24

Care volumes and costs are higher since q1 profit warning on 17th April and broaden out somewhat but little detail given. 

Thesis broken. 

CEO thinks they can get to target margins and growth but will have to prove it.
[13/05/2025, 13:45:47] ~ Dipesh Patel: Those margins are getting decimated. Suspect there is some way down still to go over next 12-18m. Their business model is in question. Doge probably hasn't fully taken effect on them yet either! And they really can't blame tariffs!

[13/05/2025, 13:52:42] Nick finegold: From chat gpt 

With Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) set to join the S&P 500 index on May 19, 2025, there is significant interest in understanding the implications for passive investment funds. Analysts at Bernstein estimate that this inclusion could lead to approximately $9 billion in inflows from passive funds that track the S&P 500, with an additional $7 billion potentially coming from active managers benchmarked to the index, totaling around $16 billion in net inflows . ￼ ￼
[13/05/2025, 13:52:56] Nick finegold: Market cap is just under $40bn .
[13/05/2025, 13:53:43] Nick finegold: For disclosure I have owned the stock in alpha capture for some time .
[13/05/2025, 15:03:03] ~ William Nutting: Put together a few quick thoughts and writing ..

MARKET: it showed us yesterday that it’s still overrun with scared primates with FOMO. Trump saw a future reality of empty shelves and ships and tough midterms. Yes, classic “Art of the Deal”! He simply pivoted to business as usual.
Now, a benign CPI gives no excuse for Fed not to cut rates. No printing = weaker Gold / better Equities. 
Nutstuff is currently writing a new THINK piece: …. sure plenty of non-US things to own but Nutstuff says bollox to this being “the beginning of the end of American exceptionalism”. Thats going to take much longer to play out. 
“The Great Rebalancing is not reactionary. It is actually corrective. It is what happens when the scaffolding of denial simply collapses.” ( out tomorrow). 

ON STOCKS: UK oil spec-sits masses of alpha and noone cares. To name a few we own and the odd we dont: HIMS, COINBASE, GME, UBER, COF, MSFT, TXN etc & even an NVDA to $125 and a SOX Index up. 
Also heads-up, more great data from Mediwound/ MDWD. A definite SHAREFLIX target! https://ir.mediwound.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mediwound-announces-publication-phase-ii-escharexr-data.

[13/05/2025, 22:24:30] Nick finegold: More than half of the UK population could benefit from weekly injections, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, experts said, which would deliver “substantial” long-term economic benefits and alleviate pressure on the NHS.
[13/05/2025, 22:26:35] ~ Jeremy Isaacs: Lots of unpleasant side effects not a free pass
[13/05/2025, 22:29:03] Nick finegold: Indeed . It’s complex , but it’s interesting. Because if it drives healthcare costs down , the big thing maybe how much can you make , not price ?
[14/05/2025, 05:51:09] ~ William Nutting: WEED WEED! Glasshouse Farms/ GLASF US: reported Q1 results and this is another transitional quarter for the company. Earnings beat, termed out debt maturing in 2026 to 2030, new greenhouse (2) to generate cannabis revenue by year end, and THE big move into hemp with plans for revenue generation by year end. Remember that hemp can be sold across the US as it legal via the 2018 farm bill...

[14/05/2025, 08:03:34] Calum Curation: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/large-hadron-collider-lead-gold-b2749928.html

Given what lab diamonds did to the diamond price this is potentially a development to watch for long term gold holders.
[14/05/2025, 08:35:24] ~ Richard Windsor: depends how much it costs to make the gold.. if its $20,000 per oz then its a nothing burger
[14/05/2025, 08:38:59] Calum Curation: It cost $4000 per carat to produce a lab grown diamond in 2008 vs $400 today. And you’d have to think if it is possible to make lab gold there would be enough incentive to get the cost down significantly eventually.
[14/05/2025, 08:40:36] ~ Richard Windsor: unless its cheaper to dig it up out of the ground...
[14/05/2025, 08:42:23] Nick finegold: Always good to monitor edge risks
[14/05/2025, 08:56:08] ~ Chris Huggins: They had to use a large hadron collider to create 29trillionths of a gram 🤣

But I guess there might be a cheaper way of stripping protons from lead. Paul Mann probably has a view!

[14/05/2025, 18:21:44] ~ SSCOOK: Anyone looking for an idea in the periphery banking space should put Bank of Cyprus on their radar. Stock has run up like the rest of Southern  European banks but still trades at a decent discount to other Euro periphery banks and is still on ~6x PE even after the big run. By the numbers BOCH has one of best balance sheets in terms of capital (CET1 20%) and deposit funding  franchises (LDR 50%)and its capital mgt yield (dps/buyback) is 11%. Their restructuring  story is on par with other euro banks (better asset quality and cost efficiency) but not sure how many investors know this or care? Cyprus country macro is in good shape & much better than the other peripheries and much of the wider eurozone (better gdp growth, 65% govt debt/gdp, fiscal surplus etc.). Relative to when I last looked at this stock 10 years ago…both the Russians and the Cypriot government are gone. The company moved its listing back to Athens from London last fall which should help as everyone loves the Greek banks…at least for now. Loan growth is starting to pick up and they are transparent about what lower ECB rates means for them. This is clearly the market neglect story of the peripheries and the only pure play way to get exposure to Cyprus. ‎<This message was edited>
[14/05/2025, 18:41:54] ~ Richard OConnor: What is the price to book and rote please? Thanks
[14/05/2025, 18:48:42] ~ SSCOOK: 1x price/book. ROTE 17%…could track lower as lower ECB rates flow through. The ROTE has to be viewed  alongside the high 19.9% CET1…they project 800bps of excess capital over required (not sure they have said much about returning any of this).
[14/05/2025, 18:59:22] ~ Richard OConnor: Thanks so the rote ex surplus cash yielding 3% say pre tax is closer to over 25% for 1x book.
[14/05/2025, 19:01:28] ~ Richard OConnor: But of course lower rates will hit but that rote is not uncommon for a dominant retail and commercial bank in a decent economy. Valuation looks fine
[14/05/2025, 19:09:51] ~ SSCOOK: Your math is not far off. They use 15% CET1 as cut off for ROTE comp > so prob close to 22% excluding the surplus. At a 52 week high as is the SX7P today…just to have all cards on the table. ‎<This message was edited>

[15/05/2025, 15:09:34] ~ William Nutting: IDEAS & CONVICTION: 
TELECOMS/ WIRELESS = “NEEDS”.
Nutstuff owns 2 high conviction posns.

1. is HELIUM where the dullness of this blockchain enabled telco ( the fastest growing now in the US) is diametrically opposite to all the incredibly +ve data. This is the beneficiary of the wireless subscriber bleed from Verizon & AT&T. $600m for a co. that  might easily be the off-take for 2-5% of US wireless data.

2.VEON is roaring again…
Noone writes on this and have owned from when they had russian assets. No more.
A reminder of thesis:
A Classic EM best of breed company US listed, is @$3.6bn (the old Vimpelcom) still cheapest US listed EM wireless play. Global
footprint, with operations spanning Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan under brands such as Jazz, Kyivstar, Banglalink, and Beeline. To me Currencies remain key and this a great re-
rating of EM currencies “ needs” play. Change and turmoil and likes of what is happening in Pakistan means $4 dollar ARPU’s not $2. A classic EM Consumer play. 156m mobile subscribers, $2bn ebitda, lowest ARPU (avge
revenue /user) in the mobile world and they will & can only grow from here, so constant currency growth of
20%+. Nothing else is valued <$100/ sub lets alone $200. Nutstuff has owned for 3 yrs + but now feels huge “game on”. Btw only 2 analysts neither I have ever heard of cover!

[15/05/2025, 16:38:51] ~ David Haysey: Unlike Berkshire (which doesn’t have to give estimated fair market valuations for its 100% owned operating businesses) 3i does have to do this for all its investments. Action (58% owned) is 76% of the portfolio by value and is valued at 18.5x trailing EBITDA net of a 5% liquidity discount. Without knowing much about the peers this doesn’t sound daft. Paying a big premium to NAV (real) for a closed end fund is a shorthand way of saying either the assets are knowingly undervalued (against the rules) or the management is so brilliant they will repeat this success with future investments.

Not too sure what’s happening as their results were due out May 20th but they appear to have released preliminary numbers.  We can now see that they are growing at 40%+ q1 this year over q1 last year and had already said they had turned ebitda positive so it’s a big inflection point . My guess is also that these numbers given the trauma of the past would be somewhat conservative .

TOPW US

WATCH BITCOIN CUSTODY PLAYS: The craziest thing about the flood of all these new Bitcoin Treasury Companies entering the market is that LITERALLY 99.9% of the world has ZERO idea what is happening and yet it is one of the BIGGEST thing to happen in finance ever!

[17/05/2025, 16:24:03] ~ Rich McDonald: Does Moody’s US downgrade matter?

What a one-notch cut means for the market, the banks, and the White House

On Friday, Moody’s pulled the trigger and stripped the US’s of its last top rating — downgrading it one notch from Aaa to Aa1.


But does it matter?

We looked into the implications of a downgrade a couple of months ago, back when Moody’s still seemed determined to ignore the sixty-foot flashing neon signage writing on the wall.

From a stock market perspective, who knows? We have no clue whether, or how much, it will matter when trading opens on Monday. Sure, S&P’s US sovereign downgrade in August 2011 prompted the worst single day fall in US stock prices since the (admittedly then recent) global financial crisis. But the market quickly recovered. This may have been people freaked out about what the downgrade might mean to the financial plumbing.

So, does the downgrade matter to financial plumbers this time? From a mechanical perspective, the answer is almost certainly “not at all”.

Banks’ risk-weighted capital asset calculations look unlikely to be impacted by the rating change. This is because regulators don’t tend to differentiate between Aaa and Aa1 when setting capital risk-weights. For example, this is how the BIS sets out its standardised approach for credit risk as it applies to individual claims to calculate their risk-weighted assets in relation to sovereigns:


Moody’s could’ve done a three-notch downgrade — from Aaa all the way to Aa3 — and nothing would’ve changed on this front.

How about collateral management? A note from Barclays on Friday night looked at the implications:

For collateral purposes, a downgrade to Aa1 is also unlikely to have an effect. For instance, DTCC and CME refer to the asset class as US Treasuries and the haircut is a function of the maturity and security type (TIPS/FRNs) but not the ratings. At LCH, a downgrade to Aa1 is unlikely to lead to a change. For instance, USTs and Gilts have similar haircuts, even as the latter are rated lower.

Furthermore, they reckon that the move won’t trigger moves at the short end of the curve because:

Legislation since the financial crisis has reduced the use of explicit ratings guidelines in investment mandates.

So, they don’t expect waves of asset sales from the circa $4.5tn in Treasury and Treasury repo in money funds.

Moving away from financial markets, the downgrade may well matter to Moody’s themselves. If S&P Global Ratings’ experience in 2011 is anything to go by, the firm will be in for a rough ride. Following S&P’s downgrade more than a decade ago, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner threw a bit of a public wobbly, and filmmaker Michael Moore called on Obama to arrest the firm’s CEO. As we wrote in March:

Someone hired a plane to fly past their rating agency’s offices dragging a banner proclaiming that they should all be fired, and a bunch of local governments terminated their business with the firm.

Meanwhile, and apparently unrelatedly, the Justice Department launched an investigation into S&P. Within a few weeks, CEO Deven Sharma had left the company. When things moved from being just an investigation to an actual $5bn federal lawsuit for allegedly misleading banks about the credibility of its ratings before the 2008 financial crisis, S&P called this direct retaliation for its downgrade.

Following the downgrade, Moritz Kraemer — formerly Global Chief Rating Officer of Sovereign Ratings at S&P Global Ratings — wrote on LinkedIn that the danger of retribution was real:

In the US, the rating agencies are regulated and licensed by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). As things stand in America today, we must wonder, whether the SEC can act independently from the wishes of the White House. Remember that the previous SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, resigned on inauguration day, making way for a Trump acolyte. Will Trump be so enraged by the downgrade of the US (which he surely will take personal) that he will demand his pound of flesh and impose revenge on Moody’s.

We’ve already seen the White House dismiss the analysis, and lash out at Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist. Steven Cheung, assistant to the President, tweeted: “Nobody takes his ‘analysis’ seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again.”

As reported in MainFT, Zandi was not an author of this report and works for Moody’s Analytics, a separate part of the company that is not part of its ratings business.

More generally, while a one-notch downgrade from Aaa may not have huge market implications it is still important.

Fiscally, Moody’s has long projected near-basket-case metrics for the United States. In reaffirming the Aaa rating back in March it wrote that the country’s Aaa rating leaned instead on the country’s “extraordinary economic strength and the unique and central roles of the dollar and Treasury bond market in global finance”.

And in its previous rating report reaffirming the Aaa rating back in November 2023, Moody’s wrote:

A weakening of institutions and governance strength, such as through deterioration in monetary and macroeconomic policy effectiveness or the quality of legislative and judicial institutions, could also strain the rating.

The world has moved on since 2023, and Moody’s is marking-to-market.
[17/05/2025, 19:30:40] Nick finegold: They are years after the other two rating agencies so it’s inconsequential. What isn’t inconsequencial is that that the debt will eventually catch up with the US and they are clearly explaining that nothing that’s happening will make a debt on the deficit. But that’s been the same for years as well.

- Moody’s d/g fires the gun (finally) for the closing stage of the Post Bretton Woods monetary order…
- Everyone watching 5% on the US 30 yr T yield; the level to ‘actually’ watch is 5.25%
- China’s selling of T Bills is close to running out of steam
- Crypto is part of the new system
- BUYing opportunity in equities - golden cross pattern
- Unprofitable tech +50% in weeks… part of the new system too?
- Swiss curve… a leading indicator for those paying attention
- Chinese housing valuations contract (again)… 4 years now without relief = Chinese deflation is structural (Japanification)

*>> BUY idea no.1:  BITCOIN* was designed for the ending of the post Bretton Woods monetary system; for the abuse of the system since the GFC, and just to pt out (despite n/t price machinations) that Moody’s finally being the last one to cut the USA’s top credit rating, should be seen as a firing gun for the parabolic move incoming for this very asset class…

[19/05/2025, 12:42:12] ~ William Nutting: All good.
As an FYI:  in the last 2 weeks I have talked a lot about what I see in the “Bitcoin custody space” which I think is fascinating. This is the next iteration of MSTR US.  
I have just added last week a max size position in ALTBG FP, @ Eur185m Mkt Cap. They are the first European-listed Bitcoin treasury company. Smart as heck team behind this and they’re executing a BTC-denominated convertible bond strategy that’s already delivering outsized returns. 
Vs MSTR or METAPLANET in Japan from here, makes great sense. I am also however RE-iterating my GAMESTOP / GME US call. ( btw Nutstuff has more detail on ALTBG for anyone curious in doing the work.)

[19/05/2025, 12:50:38] ~ Rich McDonald: Very interesting, William. 

I’ve also taken an interest in this space in the last 2 weeks, with the first UK listed “Bitcoin treasury” company (it has the same Non-exec director as Metaplanet!)

I’ve just interviewed Andrew Webley the CEO, who is ex-Head of Digital at Hargreave’s Lansdown for many years. 

The stock is The Smarter Web Company (SWC LN), its only £45m market cap at the moment (too small for here… but it has already 8x since IPO in three weeks) and have big plans over the coming weeks.

I’ll be airing the interview on Trade Live With IG on YouTube tomorrow morning at 9.30am for anyone interested.

[19/05/2025, 12:58:51] ~ William Nutting: Rich am Happy to discuss here too with you as the Sycamore Gap Fund has been involved with this space from the early days …
This metric is going to be something many will be talking about now:

“Months to mNAV Coverage (MmC) is the best framework for valuing BTC treasury companies.
Formula: (FD Market Cap – BTC Value) / Monthly BTC Acquired.
It simply tells you how fast the company can grow into its valuation — the lower the MmC, the stronger the flywheel.

[19/05/2025, 13:22:00] ~ Ben Finegold: @⁨~Katie Jackson⁩ probably best placed to answer this as assume call was recorded?
[19/05/2025, 13:42:26] ~ Katie Jackson: Cory explained that the industry would welcome a reversal with open arms, especially considering that Germany has been a poster child of the anti-nuclear movement.

After the Ukraine war began, there were early hints that Germany might consider restarting its reactors. However, one major barrier is that utilities had already sold their nuclear fuel inventory, making a restart logistically difficult. Orano (a French nuclear fuel cycle company) offered to help supply fuel if needed, showing industry support.

However, momentum slowed when utilities pointed out they had already spent significant funds on decommissioning. If they were to reverse that decision, they’d want to be made financially whole — and restarting would also require substantial new investment. This has likely discouraged further consideration of a reversal.

Cory concluded that while Europe overall is ahead of the U.S. in nuclear labor and supply chain readiness, recommissioning in Germany remains a difficult political and economic sell at this point. That said, if Germany did reverse course, the industry would absolutely support it.
[19/05/2025, 14:12:50] ~ Katie Jackson: A negative turn in Swiss short-end yields is typically a forward-looking signal of economic weakness, monetary easing, or rising global risk aversion — and is often watched as a canary in the coal mine for broader macro shifts.

Switzerland has historically had very low or even negative interest rates, making its short-term yields highly sensitive to global monetary trends. Changes in Swiss short-end yields often reflect anticipated moves by other major central banks (like the ECB or Fed), acting as an early signal of global rate shifts. 🤓 ‎<This message was edited>

Vatican move might be genius too. 

….Just completed my two hour call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. 

I believe it went very well. 

Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War. 

The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of. 

The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent. If it wasn’t, I would say so now, rather than later. 

Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic “bloodbath” is over, and I agree. 

There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED. Likewise, Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on Trade, in the process of rebuilding its Country. 

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will begin immediately. 

I have so informed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, President Emmanuel Macron, of France, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, of Italy, Chancellor Friedrich Merz, of Germany, and President Alexander Stubb, of Finland, during a call with me, immediately after the call with President Putin. 

The Vatican, as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations. 

Let the process begin!
[19/05/2025, 21:33:04] ~ Ben Finegold: Big News from South Africa: TerraPower and ASP Isotopes Strike Groundbreaking HALEU Deal

We're excited to share major developments out of South Africa as TerraPower and ASP Isotopes (ASPI) enter into definitive agreements to reshape the future of advanced nuclear fuel production.

Key Highlights:

* Strategic Loan Agreement - TerraPower will provide a term loan to partially fund the construction of a first-of-its-kind HALEU (High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium) enrichment facility in South Africa. ASPI is currently in discussions with financial institutions for the remaining non-dilutive financing, protecting current shareholder value.

* Long-Term Supply Agreement - A 10-year contract has been signed for 150 metric tonnes of HALEU, with deliveries set to begin in 2028 and continue through 2037. The new enrichment facility, located at Pelindaba, is designed to produce up to 15 MTU annually, with production slated to begin in 2027, pending regulatory approvals.

* Future U.S. Expansion Potential - TerraPower and ASPI will also explore collaboration opportunities to establish domestic uranium enrichment capabilities in the United States, tapping into ASPI’s innovative technologies in a new geography.

This landmark partnership is a major step forward for the global HALEU supply chain—and a strong signal of commercial momentum for ASPI.

[20/05/2025, 14:56:17] ~ JB: The US govt. classifies helium as a critical material for many industries including semis, medical, space and nuclear.
 
The helium market is circa $16bn today and is likely to double from here given the structural growth in demand.
Up until now there have been very few liquid ways to play helium in the equity market, it is less than 5-10% of Linde’s business despite having the highest growth, margins and ROIC.
Linde, Air Products and Air Liquide trade on average multiples of 25x 2025 PE and 15x EV/EBITDA
 
ASPI has been tracking Renergen for over 3 years and is buying it today at a fraction of its underlying value, in fact less than 10cents in the dollar to the Sproule independent NPV of $2.3bn.
Since the NPV was calculated in 2021, helium prices are up over 150%.
 
There are significant revenue and cost synergies which APSI can utilise in buying this business.
 
ASPI has signed a term sheet with a large institutional investor for $30m to provide the cash to get this project to $8m of ebitda for 2026, making it very accretive from next year.
The DFC (US govt) and other lenders are providing $750m of low-rate debt to complete phase 2 of the project and help the newco produce over $300m of EBITDA by 2030.
 
Last night ASPI announced a definitive agreement with Terra Power for 15mtu of HALEU pa for 10 years. 
The QLE spin off will take place in the 2H of 2025.
 

The webinar will be well worth listening to.

Deal announcement

https://ir.aspisotopes.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/63/asp-isotopes-inc-announces-an-agreement-relating-to-the

 

Transaction Summary
Buyer: ASP Isotopes (ASPI)
Target: Renergen (via acquisition of its equity and assumption of debt)
Total Consideration:
$107.3m equity value shares at $7.52/share (closing price May 19th)
14,270,000 shares = 19% of shares outstanding
Renergen market cap = $60.5m (closing price May 19th)
Renergen assumed debt of $54.5m
Renergen EV = $115m
Total bid with ASPI assuming all debt = $161.8m
Valuation Context:
40% premium to the Enterprise Value of the business
<10% of the latest $2.3bn independently evaluated NPV – which is only 9% of the total estimated gas in place
~70% discount to the $530m implied valuation in a December 2023 transaction with a South African Private Equity Fund
<10% of the latest $2.3bn independently evaluated NPV – which is only 9% of the total estimated gas in place
Renergen shares are down -85% from their peak in March, 2022
Funding Structure:
Phase 1C completion (~$30m) to be funded from ASPI's $61.9m balance sheet cash as of December 31st, 2024
Phase 1C would generate >$25m in annual revenues and ~$8.5m in EBITDA
Phase 2 funding de-risked:
$500m low-interest loan from the US DFC at a very attractive interest rate
$250m loan from Standard Bank of South Africa
 
Timing:
Phase 1C completion targeted for 2Q 2026
Full Phase 2 commercial ramp-up by 2030
Strategic Highlights
1. Entry into the Global Helium Market via a High-Grade Asset
Renergen owns a vast helium field, among the highest-grade globally, ranging from 2-12%, with the average of 3.4% being >10x global average.
Helium is a non-substitutable input across critical sectors: semiconductors, MRI scanners, energy (nuclear and solar), and rocketry.
ASPI enters a market forecast to grow at 8.3% CAGR to $32bn by 2032.
Helium prices have appreciated by over 20% CAGR over the last decade and have suffered four global shortages since 2006.
2. Underpriced Strategic Asset with Proven Government Backing
ASPI acquires the asset at <10% of its NPV and well below comparable private equity valuations.
The US DFC’s $500m loan commitment and a recent South African court win further de-risk the opportunity and enhance upside.
The DFC loan rate is 5.25% versus the current South African government borrowing rate of 11.5% reflects the critical nature of the asset and associated risks.
Renergen’s relationship with the US Government could provide ASPI a geopolitical and commercial edge.
3. Value Creation Through Cost Synergies and Energy Advantage
Renergen’s access to ultra-cheap gas/LNG (~$0.35/mcf) allows ASPI to reduce isotope production costs by up to 94%.
Shared infrastructure, personnel, and operations create significant cost and revenue synergies.
ASPI will apply its proven cost discipline and project execution to enhance asset performance.
Operational Outlook
Phase 1C
Completion cost: $30m
Funding: ASP Isotopes Balance Sheet Cash
EBITDA upon completion: $8.5m annually
Multiple: ~16.5x 2026E EBITDA
Phase 2
Target EBITDA:
$300m in 2030
EV/EBIDTA 0.54x 2030E
Market and Customer Synergies
Semiconductors & AI – 24% of total helium demand growing at >11% CAGR for the next 5 years
Renergen’s helium is essential for chip etching and cooling.
ASPI’s isotopes (e.g., Si-28) are critical to quantum computing.
Combined entity becomes a strategic, dual-source supplier to major US and global semiconductor firms.
Medical – 25% of helium demand
Renergen: helium for MRI machines.  The MRI market is approx. $7.5bn growing at 6.5% CAGR driven by ageing population, a growing middle class and the growth in sport and fitness.
ASPI: isotopes (Yb-176, C-14) for diagnostics
Creates full-chain medical imaging and nuclear medicine offering.
Nuclear Power – 10% of helium demand
Helium is used as coolant in HTGRs/SMRs.
ASPI also supplies enriched nuclear fuel.
Combined offering increases relevance to next-gen nuclear developers.
Aerospace – 18% of helium demand
NASA’s Artemis program requires 3.2mcf per SLS launch.
Each Space X Starship and Falcon-9 Heavy launch is estimated to consume around 14-18% of global daily helium production – 106 Falcon-9 launches in 2024
Geographic and Strategic Expansion
Austin, Texas HQ provides ASPI direct access to the US semiconductor corridor.
Johannesburg office strengthens presence in Africa, supports operational scale-up.
South African listing offers local investors immediate exposure to ASPI via Renergen stock.
Additional Benefits
Enhances ASPI’s profile as a critical materials company, increasing appeal to institutional investors.
Expanded R&D capabilities and global customer footprint.
Management has a track record of on-the-ground oversight and successful project delivery in South Africa.
Timing is optimal: share price low, recent court case win, Phase 1 progress, and strategic financing secured.
Conclusion
ASPI’s acquisition of Renergen offers a compelling combination of undervalued strategic assets, secure funding, and synergistic product and customer overlap.
It is a rare chance to enter a growing, non-substitutable market at a steep discount with meaningful upside in scale, margin, and relevance.
The acquisition firmly positions ASPI as a diversified, indispensable player in next-generation industrial, medical, and energy systems.
The significant growth potential of QLE (HALEU), PET Labs (Medical), and an Industrial Gases business that now includes helium, means ASPI is going to be a much bigger company which significantly widens its investor universe.
Paul Mann, the CEO of ASP Isotopes, remains focused on building a company with recurring revenues, high and sustainable margins and ROIC.

[20/05/2025, 15:51:19] Nick finegold: Yup my feeling on Aspi is that the Terra power deal underwrites the flotation later in the year for QLE . Which is probably most of the current market cap. Then you have the isotopes business kicking in next year , then you have helium . May take a little time to take on board and a few firm forecasts for  the isotopes business  would be helpful but the helium chip, data centre cooling story will draw more eyeballs in time . ‎<This message was edited>

[21/05/2025, 06:41:43] Nick finegold: Genuinely think I had one too many and hit the wrong group
[21/05/2025, 06:45:57] Nick finegold: I have felt this way for a number of days now . It’s time to say bye bye to Bitcoin. 

Lots of you tracking it as it breaks $108k. It’s never really done its stuff post halving, 

Safest way to play the rally , buy Coinbase or BTC / Ethereum itself . 

Most geared : volatile microstrategy or Riot platforms . 

I have been long Coinbase a while .
[21/05/2025, 07:10:53] Nick finegold: Also Tesla autonomous cars due on the roads in Austin in the next 40 days . Musk of CNBC yesterday and Morgan Stanley commentating again on why it’s NOT a car company , and is moving on to autonomy and robots.
[21/05/2025, 07:38:22] ~ JB: What happens to car volumes when autonomous cars are available?
[21/05/2025, 07:51:52] ~ Katie Jackson: *BTC: 3 clear catalysts - insight from Smiths Market Insights*

1.⁠ ⁠*BOJ on cusp of monetising whole system*: BOJ already owns >50% of JGB market. Normalisation attempts are causing the system to blow-up and threaten ROW contagion risk. BOJ needs to enact yield curve control and buy more to avoid. Bitcoin is the antidode to monetisation of the system (not just in Japan but in ROW). 

2.⁠ *⁠US Debt Bill driving corporates into Bitcoin*: Tax Bill is entering its final haggling stages. It will pass and will rocket the already stratospheric US debt position. American corporates stepping in as the marginal buyer for Bitcoin - see charts to follow

3.⁠ ⁠*US crypto regulatory framework*: Due in July will be the catalyst for en masse Bitcoin ownership. Even your granny will have some after this!

_*>> Single stock investors should BUY companies with large bitcoin balance sheets i.e. MSTR, TSLA and COIN_* 

*_>> Catalyst 1 and 2 also applicable to GOLD*_

*_>> VERY interest write up in Smith Market Insight - please let me know if you would like free subscription for a year*_

[21/05/2025, 07:52:00] ~ Tim Sykes: VW did a study on car usage. Cars are used under 5%. They are parked rather than driven. This is why they flirted with ride hailing. Do folks need to own autonomous cars? Or will they just hail them?

Yes, its increasingly clear that many paths are now leading to wider adoption of a Harder Money and an alternative financial system. TRADFI people just only waking up to this now. 
Whats fascinating is Retail are yet to really show up on this move. 

To quote Raoul: “ We're at 3.3% of the road to a 100T crypto market cap.” How can anyone not be intrigued by the opportunity…?
Ans yes even Jamie Dimon has done a screeching u-turn on Bitcoin! 

Nick F says sell BITCOIN, in favour of I guess higher Octane plays. Thats an interesting call. 

To me its all about having a “bag of Golf Clubs.”

BITCOIN
L1’s: ETHE and SOLANA
BLOCKCHAIN NATIVE: HELIUM ( the user data is meteoric)
SUI the waanabe.( see MSFT integration)
RETAIL / CUSTODY: COINBASE.

Then there are the New and emerging BITCOIN TREASURY COMPANIES. 
MSTR & Saylor for sure, but this where I want the largest bet, balanced with a few pure Self-custody Bitcoins. 

So, Nutstuffs biggest bets remain in: GAMESTOP / GME and in ALTBG FP. € 331m. (Adam Back is behind and a crypto native and named in the Bitcoin white paper) and is +140% from entry. If momentum in Bitcoin continues I can see 4-5X from here with simple Saylor maths. 
I suspect you will now see BTC “in-kind” inflows that are truly mental. Also a reminder that The BlockChain Group will be increasing its capital raising ability to over €10bn on 10th June (next month). ( as a €300m euro co.?!) 

Also again a mention of this: 
“Months to mNAV Coverage (MmC) is the best framework for valuing BTC treasury companies. Formula: (FD Market Cap – BTC Value) / Monthly BTC Acquired.
It simply tells you how fast the company can grow into its valuation the lower the MmC, the stronger the flywheel. ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 09:02:09] ~ Richard Windsor: Depends. Many will do this but some wont want other people leaving chewing gum on their carpets. The net result is a 5x reduction in the number of cars needed to satisfy the transportation requirements of a market like USA. Probably more for Europe where the population is more geogoraojically concentrated.
[21/05/2025, 09:07:12] Nick finegold: I didn’t say sell BTC at all , I said there are a range of ways to play the situation if you are of the belief that it breaks out quite quickly now , with different risk profiles. Or at least that’s what I had intended to say . Owning BTC is just one way. ‎<This message was edited>

[22/05/2025, 11:13:20] ~ Andrew Cawker: Long Bloomberg commentary on JGB’s liquidity and risks:-

https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/SWNL78DWX2PS
[22/05/2025, 11:14:15] ~ Andrew Cawker: The summary last few paragraphs:- 

“The Bank of Japan’s colossus of a balance sheet represents one of the biggest threats to financial stability in Japan and around the world. A rise in yields represents a far from trivial loss to the BOJ’s $4 trillion of JGBs, accounting for almost 80% of its balance sheet.
No problem, you might say, for a central bank with potentially limitless capital. But the market is not stupid: that loss will eventually be patched over with freshly printed, inflation-stoking money, leading to more JGB selling. In extremis, the BOJ ends up owning the whole JGB market, and the yen becomes the primary mechanism of adjustment.
As domestic investors lose money and financial risks rise, the likelihood is that some of Japan’s huge net creditor position with the rest of the world is repatriated, leading to asset declines worldwide, especially in the US and Europe.
The majority of investors and consumers in Japan have never had to contend with inflation much above 1% for most of their adult lives. But belatedly or not, when they move to preserve their purchasing power the impact on inflation and yields — amplified by the BOJ’s duration-laden balance sheet — has the potential to be systemic. And it won’t just be Japan’s problem.”

[23/05/2025, 10:36:07] ~ Ben Finegold: “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.”—Saul Alinsky

President Dwight D. Eisenhower was the original driving force behind the creation of the US civilian nuclear power sector. The vast majority of the current fleet of 94 operating reactors in the country can be traced back to his personal leadership, beginning with the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1954. The AEC was charged with weapons development, safety regulations, and—critically—encouraging private investment in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, especially for electric power. The subsequent two decades saw Eisenhower’s vision carried out with military discipline as the AEC partnered with industry to facilitate the construction of new reactors.

Ironically, things came to a grinding halt after the energy crisis of 1973. One might have expected the oil embargo to motivate the US to accelerate its civilian nuclear ambitions. Instead, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 effectively abolished the AEC and transferred regulatory oversight to the newly formed Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC’s mandate was limited strictly to regulation and safety, while promotional objectives were deemphasized. It didn’t take long for the new regime to effectively halt new reactor construction in the country.

End of an era, beginning of an error | NRC

The main weapon of the NRC is the linear no-threshold (LNT) model—an unscientific ethos that treats all exposure to radiation, no matter how minute, as both dangerous and cumulative. In other words, there is no threshold below which otherwise insignificant exposures are considered harmless. Combined with the risk-averse bureaucrat mindset and you get this astonishing result: only two of the current fleet of US reactors were approved and built under the auspices of the NRC.

For anti-nuclear Malthusian environmentalists, the LNT model is ideal. It allows them to actively stunt the creation and distribution of energy abundance while shielding themselves behind the guise of safety and alleged expertise. Zero is an emotional number and when any amount of radiation is viewed as inherently bad, the complete absence of exposure is treated as inherently good, regardless of the positive tradeoffs foregone as a consequence.

For evidence, look no further than the medical industry where controlled radiation exposure can be incredibly powerful in treating sick patients. In diagnostics, radiation allows doctors to see inside the body with remarkable detail in a non-invasive manner. It is also used in various treatments, most commonly in the targeted destruction of cancer cells. Despite the medically beneficial attributes of radiation, its use in healthcare is greatly impeded by the LNT mindset. Patients arrive at clinics with unfounded fears that lead to avoidance of care. Excessive regulatory costs steer providers toward suboptimal treatment strategies that avoid radiation altogether. Innovation is stifled, as scientists and medical companies proactively avoid exploring the beneficial aspects of the technology. This is from a recent and scathing editorial published in The Journal of Nuclear Medicine last August:

“Had the scientific community not adhered to the LNT model but instead explored radiation hormesis in clinical trials when it was proposed in the 1980s by Luckey, adoption of radiation hormesis might have led to reduction in cancer deaths by around 20%. This would have translated to preventing nearly 2 million cancer deaths in 2022 alone, given the staggering global toll of 9.7 million cancer deaths that year. Thus, the decision of advisory bodies to persist with the LNT model, despite published evidence supporting radiation hormesis, may have contributed to millions of preventable cancer deaths over recent decades.”

Amid the flurry of executive actions undertaken in the early days of President Donald Trump’s second administration, hopeful signs are emerging that the US may finally discard the destructive LNT framework. LNT is wholly incompatible with both his US energy dominance agenda and the military’s desire to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race—and it is this second objective that may provide Trump with the legal cover needed to reverse five decades of deeply flawed policy. Let’s explore why and gauge the odds of success.

On February 18, Trump signed Executive Order 14215, titled Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies. The order begins by noting that the US Constitution vests all executive power in the President alone, who “in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people.” It then outlines how independent agencies, including the NRC, have effectively usurped presidential authority and oversight:

“However, previous administrations have allowed so-called ‘independent regulatory agencies’ to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.

These practices undermine such regulatory agencies' accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President.”

The expert class of do-gooders reacted to this order with predictable horror. Allison McFarlane, who was appointed to the NRC by former President Barack Obama in 2012 and became its chair in 2013, took to the pages of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to sound the alarm:

“In the past, the president and Congress, which has oversight capacity on the regulators, stayed at arm’s length from the regulators’ decisions. This was meant to keep them isolated, ensuring their necessary independence from any outside interference. Trump’s executive order implies there are no longer independent regulators in the United States.

Independent regulators should not only be free from government and industry meddling; they also need to be adequately staffed with competent experts and have the budget to operate efficiently. They also need to be able to shut down facilities such as nuclear power plants that are not operating safely, according to regulations. To do this, they need government to support their independent decisions and rulemaking.”
Two weeks ago, drafts of potential follow-on orders building upon EO 14215 were leaked to various legacy media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times. In The Washington Post, we learn that at least one of the drafts offers a clear diagnosis of the root cause of the country’s nuclear stagnation:

“The NRC does not view its duty as promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy with regulatory clarity, flexibility and speed but rather insulating Americans from the most remote risks without regard for the domestic or geopolitical costs of its risk aversion.”
For the clearest indication of Trump’s intent to radically accelerate the proper buildout of new reactors in the country, we turn to The New York Times:

“The draft orders say the United States has fallen behind China in expanding nuclear power and call for a ‘wholesale revision’ of federal safety regulations to make it easier to build new plants. They envision the Department of Defense taking a prominent role in ordering reactors and installing them on military bases.

They would also set a goal of quadrupling the size of the nation’s fleet of nuclear power plants, from nearly 100 gigawatts of electric capacity today to 400 gigawatts by 2050. One gigawatt is enough to power nearly 1 million homes…

One option under consideration would be to designate certain A.I. data centers as ‘defense critical infrastructure’ and allow them to be powered by reactors built on Department of Energy facilities, which may allow projects to avoid review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.”

The concept of building nuclear-powered data centers on military bases is—to state it frankly—brilliant. Presumably, Trump will lean heavily on the authority afforded to the president by the Defense Production Act, among other justifications. As we have long chronicled in these pages, China is much further along in the AI race than most believe. And not by coincidence, the country is also set to surpass the US in installed nuclear power capacity:

“China has approved plans for building 10 nuclear reactors for 200 billion yuan ($27.7 billion), putting the country on track to push its nuclear power generation capacity past the US to become the world's largest by 2030.”

For all the controversy surrounding the man and his approach to governing, if President Trump succeeds in reining in the NRC, eliminating the LNT model, and catalyzing the construction of dozens of new nuclear power reactors across the US, he will bequeath future generations of Americans a legacy on par with that of Eisenhower. Here’s to hoping he gets it done.
[23/05/2025, 10:37:31] ~ JB: IMHO the AI boom doesn’t happen with out plenty more clean base load power .

US nuclear capacity growing 4x is a major part of that.

Nuclear energy stocks soared in premarket trading Friday ahead of the prospective signing of executive orders by President Donald Trump.

The new orders are expected to kickstart the production of nuclear power in the U.S. by easing the regulatory process on approvals for new reactors and directing the Departments of Energy and Defense to identify federal lands for nuclear deployment, streamlining the current process under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Shares of Centrus Energy LEU, Lightbridge LTBR, and NuScale Power SMR jumped 22%, 18%, and 17%, respectively, in premarket trading.

🔥A new trade idea - If you are Bearish on the Nikkei 225 index 🔥

Its in USD, issued by BNP and a 2-year term.
If the index goes up - your capital is 100% protected, therefore no short squeeze exposure.

At maturity in two years, you get the closing level as your return, but capped at 20%.

So if the Nikkei is down 25%, your return will only be 20%

[24/05/2025, 10:13:50] ~ William Nutting: A few asking me about the latest Trump Grandstanding crass stupidity…
“Tariffing Bitcoin based on where it was mined.”

Donald, is there really noone giving you intelligent perspective when you think this stuff up on the hoof?  Clearly not..

Nutstuff would assert that it is impossible to enforce any tariff on Bitcoin using blockchain data. 
Trump clearly has zero understanding of mining pool architecture and how transactions and blocks work. It's like trying to tax email based on where the server that processed it is based, its just technically incoherent.
Most blocks are produced by mining pools, which aggregate hashpower from contributors globally. The entity submitting the block (the pool) is not necessarily the one that did the actual hashing.
A block mined by a U.S.-based pool may include contributions from:
China, Russia, Venezuela. Unknown IPs via VPN/Tor. Put another way, imposing a tariff on non-U.S. mined Bitcoin is like a 19th-century government trying to levy a tax on foreign wind blowing across its borders.
Wind doesn’t recognise national boundaries. It moves freely, driven by natural forces beyond political control. You can’t fence it in, label it “domestic,” or charge it for arriving from overseas. The very attempt reveals a deep misunderstanding of its nature and the futility of using old tools on a new reality.
Bitcoin is digital wind, Borderless, Permissionless. Composed of math, not matter. Its value and motion arise from global consensus, not national decree.
Trying to apply tariffs or import duties to Bitcoin based on where they were mined is a relic of a world where power was enforced by controlling ports, rails, or oil wells. Bitcoin routes around all of that. The harder you try to bend it to old systems, the more it simply reflects their irrelevance.

Evening with Raoul Pal

Your Intro to one of the Biggest Macro Calls of a Lifetime

This isn’t just another Bitcoin/ crypto zoom call, 
It’s a moment of choice and you can be in the room , enjoy some drinks on us and meet our members.  

Regardless of ones views on Trump , Will you align yourself  with the President—or sit this one out in disgust ?

Because crypto is now a policy tool.
New U.S. regulatory frameworks are coming in July.
Bitcoin has pushed  past $100K again. 
And Trump—love him or not—is leaning into digital assets and with some price targets exceed $1m per BTC one needs an informed view on what’s next. 

Raoul Pal, world-class macro mind and crypto authority, is joining us for what may be the defining call of this cycle.

He’s seen the debt crisis.
He called the rise of Sui a new currency he thinks has legs & he’s got his eyes focussed on what’s next.

This isn’t about politics.
It’s about wealth accumulation vs destruction and a simple choice. 

Will you choose to be informed, and in the room—or miss the signal completely?

This moment in time maybe one for the history books.

If you have an interest in attending for free register here and our team will be in touch .

[29/05/2025, 07:47:44] ~ Katie Jackson: *Smith Market Insight comments:*

That Trump has overstepped the authority of the Presidency by invoking national emergency laws to impose tariffs globally
 
Here’s the thing(s)
 
1. If this is the case? And that the Court ruling is going to hold - (it won’t) (and obviously Trump is immediately appealing as this goes to the Supreme Court (his Supreme Court)) - what happens with the national debt calculations? Considering just how much ALREADY tariffs have brought in? and just how much the budget blows out (further) if said money is to be repaid? (let alone the logistics of it)….answer? the debt calculations go into exponential overdrive (and that isn’t good!)
 
2. What about game theory? If you’re the EU, Japan, China, India, SK etc…..why would you negotiate (you would of course continue to pay lip-service to negotiations) but why at this juncture now really negotiate in earnest/good faith when the chance is there (however slim) that all of this tariff imposition is defunct and just won’t happen at all?
 
3. Uncertainty……even with tariffs at least global trading elements have a degree of certainty ahead that tariffs are here, and it merely comes down to the level(s) ‘of’ said tariffs not the fact……but now? just throw another spanner in the uncertainty works essentially – no one has a clue!?
 
 
_*BUY RISK (for Global M Supply reasons; CB ahead views; NVDA details on A.I etc) but these points (1, 2 and 3) seem rather valid? As futures cheer this Court move in the immediacy as essentially no one has a clue what this all means*_

[29/05/2025, 10:09:30] ~ Matt H: Cobalt is interesting. I raised a lot for the first iteration Cobalt 27 (which also had royalties). It might be a good trade here with depressed cobalt prices but it’s different to Yellowcake and the uranium market. Production can come on relatively easily and cobalt can be substituted if the price gets too high.
[29/05/2025, 10:33:34] Nick finegold: The key thing for me is that this market is a tiny fraction of the size of uranium and this deal moves the market from oversupply to in line . 

Ie it’s a market that can easily cornered . 

The assessment one has to make is whether it trades at a discount despite there being a mechanism in place to buy shares if it trades below par . 

If you like cobalt long term why not ? ‎<This message was edited>
[29/05/2025, 10:55:55] ~ Matt H: That’s the point. To buy here is a good idea as it can’t really go any lower but I don’t like cobalt long term . It’s a 1-2 year trade and then supply and substitution will come back.

[31/05/2025, 15:20:37] Nick finegold: From Nick L at OWL 

Last week, Bill Ackman enjoyed a big boost as shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac surged following President Trump’s announcement plans to take these government-controlled mortgage giants public. Ackman sees this restructuring as a historic opportunity to unlock significant value, estimating a potential $300 billion windfall.

Whilst Pershing Square’s shares have rallied 8% in May, the fund’s NAV has been growing even faster. As of Friday, PSH LN closed at £39.14, representing a 34% discount to its NAV of £59.28. I’ve watched this stock closely since I helped list it in 2014, when its discount ranged from around 15-20% during stable markets to nearly 40% during periods of heightened volatility. Notably, in 2016 and before the 2020 market correction, the discount approached near-zero levels.

Adding to the positive outlook, asset manager Tidal Trust recently filed to launch an ETF based on Ackman’s concentrated portfolio, called the “Vista Shares Pershing Square Select ETF ” further underscoring the market’s optimism surrounding Ackman’s strategy.

Owning UBER, HHH, CMG, BN, UMG, QSR as well as Fannie and Freddie at 35% discount isn't a bad trade.

[01/06/2025, 07:55:18] ~ Matt H: Anglo American’s $11bn platinum spin-off makes London market debut  https://on.ft.com/43WGiw8
[01/06/2025, 08:04:02] ~ Matt H: I often get asked about platinum/palladium and when it might rebound from depressed prices. The metal is in a supply deficit but it’s hard to know how much OEM’s hold in inventory and who Norilsk in Russia is supplying. When Anglo spun off Thungela many funds sold as they were not allowed to hold thermal coal assets. The opening few days saw the stock sell off which was an amazing opportunity to get it and of course it helped that the thermal coal price rocketed. Valterra (Anglo Plats) is the quality play in the sector. It might be worth tucking some away if you want to play PGM’s
[01/06/2025, 08:05:32] ~ Matt H: If Marshall Wace had allowed me on TOPs (which they didn’t as mining too specialised) I would buy some on the platform.
[01/06/2025, 08:12:50] ~ Matt H: I know the head of IR at Anglo American very well and might be able to get him to present to the club if there is any interest? Anglo is disposing of non core assets which some believe may make it a bid target again (Note BHP had a tilt at Anglo a while back)
[01/06/2025, 09:42:30] Nick finegold: Thanks Matt it would be a very interesting club call as most of do not know that area  at all well , thanks for the post

[01/06/2025, 12:09:45] ~ William Nutting: GCL LN
[01/06/2025, 12:10:18] Nick finegold: Or any etf .

[01/06/2025, 12:12:31] ~ Michael Burchell: Which*
[01/06/2025, 12:13:12] Nick finegold: I will let others more knowledgable than myself answer that .
[01/06/2025, 12:14:33] ~ Ben Finegold: URA is a broader nuclear etf which includes nuclear infra + fuel 

URNM is dedicated to miners of uranium 

URNJ is for junior miners (we prefer to own Skyharbour Resources as they have interests in 36 assets in the Athabasca Basin so you get ETF style exposure but with single stock upside) 

GCL - focused primarily on North American miners where we think there is premium given the uranium deficit in the west far exceeds that of the East

Really depends what you want but URA is the broadest for the nuclear theme ‎<This message was edited>

UEC

GCL 
SPUT
[01/06/2025, 12:18:04] ~ Michael Burchell: Thank you team
[01/06/2025, 12:32:51] ~ Dipesh Patel: Would say it depends on 1) whether you want to play the fuel going into the nuclear facilities or the kit (they are two very separate dynamics) and 2) whether you want to play this directly or indirectly. Etfs is the easiest but not always the most efficient. Personally I have found Global X Uranium URNG in London a very good etf.

[02/06/2025, 07:14:37] ~ Katie Jackson: *US Steel & Tariffs: ArcelorMittal Club Stock - US exposure exempt and secured against Nippon-US merger*

As we see Asian steel makers off this morning on the tariff news over the weekend, worth remembering that… 

AM/NS Calvert in Alabama, a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, produce steel within the U.S. and are therefore exempt from these expanded import tariffs.

ArcelorMittal entered agreement with Nippon Steel in Oct ‘24 to take full control of AM/NS Calvert JV (currently 50/50 with Nippon Steel) for $1 if NSC’s U.S. Steel deal closes. NSC also agreed to inject ~$900m into Calvert pre-sale to address antitrust.

From the perspective of physical machines, the next 5 or 10 years with AI could bring more innovation than a century pre-AI. Prepare for the tech to develop far faster than the policies can keep up, uncovering areas of risk prior to unlocking the opportunity.
I'd greatly appreciate your support for the Morgan Stanley Auto & Auto Parts team in this year's All-America Extel survey. Respectfully, AJ.

US made the imposition, China's now in pole position. If it's not yet totally clear that China is in the lead on agentic robots, you won't need to wait long. According to our discussions with subject matter experts in robotics and autonomy, China's proximity to a highly advanced, vertically integrated supply chain helps pad its lead in robotics.

Hope you'll not be too annoyed, with burgers flipped by humanoid. AI robots will come in countless form factors, but the human-shaped robot may be the most profound and fastest adopting 'shape' given its ability to learn (by imitating us) and integrating into a human world 'brown-fielded' for bipedal ambulation and opposable thumbs.

Advantages we need to gain, in battle for the human brain. We want to avoid a situation where the humans get dumber faster than the robots get smarter. The race for AI robotic supremacy is a contest for the best human minds working across the knowledge economy (bits/bytes), the physical economy (atoms/photons) and manufacturing world.

Best investment for a nation, close the gap on education. According to the World Population Review, the United States ranked 31st in ‘educational rank’ which placed it between Hungary and Taiwan. South Korea, Denmark and The Netherlands got the top 3 spots. China ranked 13th in this survey, just after the UK.

Talent pool in dislocation, training for a new vocation. On Tesla's 4Q24 conference call, Elon Musk stated: "But in general, for talented Americans... we need to make manufacturing cool again in America. And like, I honestly think people should move from like law and finance into manufacturing. That's my honest opinion."

A lead in AI innovation, relies on thoughtful immigration. Elon Musk has been a consistent advocate for skilled immigration, arguing that talented immigrants are crucial for driving innovation and economic growth in the U.S., especially in fields like science, technology, and artificial intelligence. Currently 4 of the ‘Mag 7’ companies are led by CEOs who were immigrants to the US.

Imports for so long the rule, can manufacturing be cool? For the US to remain competitive in advanced robotics, it must at least slow (if not reverse) the 8-decade decline in manufacturing. Physical AI requires a persistent and rapid iteration between data capture, training and hardware optimization/manufacturing. Manufacturing expertise and critical material sourcing strategies require a wholesale re-evaluation, in our view.

I hate to drone on for eternity... but drones ensure security. China makes more drones in 1 day than the US makes in a year. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to show the deterministic role of drones on the battlefield. Elon Musk recently stated on the 1Q25 conference call: “…any country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doomed to be the vassal state of any country that can. And we can't – America cannot currently manufacture its own drones. Let that sink in."

AI's growth in GPUs, demands a source of BTUs. A successful development of US robotic capability must go hand-in-hand with a diverse and resilient energy policy. As the robots propagate and scale, the energy demands from training VLA foundation models will increase. We estimate just the physical work conducted by 1bn humanoids (excluding training) may require >4,000 TWh of incremental annual electricity demand - roughly equal to 1 full US electric grid.

State AV patchwork is a fear, caught in headlights like a deer. In a recent discussion with US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy, Elon Musk stated, “It’d be wonderful for the United States to have a national set of rules for autonomous driving instead of 50 state-specific standards.” We believe rapid improvement in AV tech both inside and outside of the US may accelerate Congressional attention on this issue.

Our rivals are not standing still, if we do nothing others will. On the 1Q25 conference call, Elon Musk stated: “With respect to humanoid robots, I don't think there's any company in any country that can match Tesla. So and then now I'm a little concerned of that on the leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies…”

Resiliency is ours to gain, re-architect the supply chain. The US economy runs on magnets. High end magnets require rare earths (NdPr, Dysprosium, Terbium). China controls 65% of mining/88% of refining of rare earths, exposing US national security vulnerabilities in the time of tariffs. Policies must determine what can/should be made on shore, near-shore and still with China.

Take a look around our shelves, we can't do it by ourselves. While there is clearly room to address critical imbalances and lopsided over-dependencies in key areas (from manufacturing to rare earth processing), we believe China will play a continuing important role in the re-architecting of a sustainable US autonomous future. Industrial and geopolitical rivalry does not exclude a healthy level of mutual economic cooperation. We look for China JVs and Chinese-derived car technology coming to US shores by end of decade.

For the safety of our nation, there's a need for regulation. The intersection of AI and robotics will transform the economy, geopolitics and societal structure. A host of moral, legal and ethical considerations will be brought to the fore. Comparisons between the propagation of AI and nuclear proliferation are accurate, in our view, and will require a robust and flexible regulatory framework to balance innovation, national security and public health and safety.

Robots not a want but need, if not TSLA who will lead? While there is a growing number of US efforts to push the boundaries of physical AI, we struggle to think of any other company as well positioned as Tesla in terms of data, robotics, energy, AI, manufacturing and supporting infrastructure (from fleet fulfillment to communications network, etc). We would love to see more competition for Tesla in these areas. In the meantime, we reiterate Tesla as our ‘Top Pick’ in US autos.

URANIUM: STOCKS/ POSITIONS: 
See todays Press release:
LTBR US just annointed: While the US governmentS consideration of providing highly enriched uranium for Lightbridge to use in FAST testing was under consideration prior to the executive orders, the government’s decision has now JUST been made!
Lightbridge will benefit from the groundbreaking FAST ("Fission Accelerated Steady-state Test") method using highly enriched uranium—a rare and tightly controlled government resource. It represents immediate implementation of Trump's directive to accelerate nuclear innovation.

URANIUM/ NUCLEAR EXPOSURES: STOCKS: LTBR (Nutstuff likes as this is Mkt cap is still tiny; $326m and is about existing and future fuel also have to think some Sell-side sponsorship shows up soon!) also ASPI, alongside RR/LN Rolls Royce (UK) OKLO & BWXT also some SPUT. If its a production play, then UEC US. 

The path to US self sufficiency in enrichment by 2030 is what matters, more investments will be needed beyond that. Conversion remains the main bottleneck, with limited near-term additions although the executive orders call for a plan to expand both conversion and enrichment to be developed by late September. For SMRs, HALEU is advancing but still pre-commercial. Can the Uranium supply chain keep up? Reshoring of the supply chain is a key focus. The US relies on imports for two-thirds of its enrichment and conversion needs, and virtually all mined uranium is sourced externally. The 2023 US mine restarts and new projects, which we estimate could meet ~40% of domestic needs by 2030, with Canada likely filling much of the remainder. Enrichment capacity is also expanding. 
“Together, Trump’s 2025 energy pivot anchored by the nuclear executive orders and EPA’s rollback of greenhouse gas rules is profoundly historic. Not just in scale, but in doctrinal ambition. It blows past any previous US energy shift. It is the single biggest US energy strategic realignment since, at least, the 1973 Oil Crisis, and the most aggressive pro-nuclear policy in world history.  No US administration since the Manhattan Project has ever tried to reorganise the nation’s entire power ecosystem supply chain, education, regulation, financing all at once. Welcome to 2025. You’re witnessing the birth of a post-climate, post-renewables energy doctrine, where not carbon but grid dominance becomes the organising principle of American power policy.”

[03/06/2025, 17:16:08] ~ William Nutting: Surprised stock not up more on this…

[03/06/2025, 21:29:32] ~ Dipesh Patel: For anyone interested in a short, CRWD looks terrible to me. I appreciate it has a lot of tailwinds and a huge fanbase, but if I put my years ago accountant hat on, it really doesn't stack up. They've grown revs 20% and gone into a loss. FCF is almost non existent. They've converted 20% of gross profit into cash as a software business (made 279m of cash on a 120bn mkt cap). I've been following it for 2-3 quarters and at best they manage to meet numbers in what must be as supportive a tailwind in cyber security and data centres. I feel as strongly on this as SBUX. I wouldn't be surprised if it halves over the next 12m. It's also not the AI play in cyber - that was darktrace that the club liked and got taken out last year by PE. Puts are definitely a safer way to play a short in this name given the 'fan' momentum. It's on 25x revs and 120x FCF, 120bn mkt cap!
[03/06/2025, 22:19:19] ~ KC Shetty: Thanks Dips. What now is your best cyber security stock please ? Or is it you like none in this sector ?
[03/06/2025, 22:20:11] ~ William Nutting: Do you like HACK US ( etf)?
[03/06/2025, 22:39:42] ~ Dipesh Patel: Probably Palo Alto. Same mkt cap, twice the revs and profitable v CRWD. That said, I don't own any of the stocks in the sector and wouldn't. I can't reconcile how at best they are meeting expectations when there is almost a daily hack out there. They just don't seem to be crushing it as they should be right now. And even when they grow 20-30% they barely get any delta on the profits or cashflows. I'm definitely NOT an expert in the space and it's dangerous using just numbers and common sense P&L and cashflow in these momentum sectors but ..... I have shorted CRWD. 
@⁨~William Nutting⁩ sorry don't know HACK but probably allows you to play the long theme without too much specific risk (not checked the weightings).

It will be interesting to see what happens to Tony Stark and Stark industries , now that he has openly criticised Donald’s , policies as an abomination. 

Think about what happened to Russian oligarchs that took on Putin ? 

Numerous ways that Trump could get Stark arrested , given that he breeches security laws weekly .  Well both of them actually .

Will stem from externalities off this theme ahead accordingly._

[04/06/2025, 10:51:32] Nick finegold: The relationship between Musk and Trump is fraying for four key reasons: the reconciliation bill cuts EV tax credits, the White House denied Musk’s effort to extend his “special gov’t employee” status, the FAA rejected the use of Starlink to run air traffic control, and Trump rescinded the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to run NASA (Axios)
[04/06/2025, 10:52:35] Nick finegold: Interesting . Why would musk want to run air traffic control ? Because the cars will grow wings and other reasons no doubt .

[04/06/2025, 11:35:48] ~ Matt H: I had to Chat GPT it: A “scalded cat chart” is not a standard or widely recognized term in data analysis, finance, or statistics. However, the phrase likely comes from the idiom “like a scalded cat,” which is used to describe something moving very fast or erratically, usually due to shock or pain.

Possible Interpretations:
	1.	Colloquial Nickname for a Chart:
It might be a jargon or slang term used informally (e.g., in finance or tech circles) to describe a chart that shows:
	•	A sudden, sharp movement — such as a stock price or metric shooting up (or down) very rapidly.
	•	Data with volatile or erratic behavior, resembling a “spooked” or “scalded” pattern.

1) TEM US (AI) - Good friend of mine, ex Apple, still connected well to silicon valley and follows a lot of the key players there. Was an early investor in Palantir and exited this year. He claims a lot of people he follows are all excited about one stock... Tempus AI (based in Chicago!!). He said Pelosi, Woods, Google all owners. He is. Strongly believes it is the next Palantir. Uses AI to map out an optimal treatment plan for patients (among other things). Scaling v fast. Apparently saving oncology (and other) consultants weeks/months in figuring out the optimal treatment plan. Literally takes minutes. Is to consultants and healthcare centres in the treatment of patients what Palantir is to certain government operations.
2) 9660 HK (Horizon Robotics). From a Middle East based private banker who came back with what he felt all the 'smart' HNW's in Asia are backing... I know of the company a little via BYD as they partner on many robotics initiatives for their cars. Surprisingly, it's profitable (on about 30x earnings). He claims if you own one play in Asia on robotics, it's this one. He's biased but thinks China way ahead on robotics and these guys are one of the companies at the forefront of the tech. Slightly odd the rating v Nvidia perhaps?

[04/06/2025, 13:06:28] ~ William Nutting: Nick. On “Stark”….

Have you had any intel from anyone on inherent limitations of Tesla’s approach to FSD? These types of stories keep on occurring and I’m puzzled as to why they don’t seem to have any impact. As it stands Tesla still hasn’t achieved FSD and I have always had this niggle that it is impossible using only simple cameras. Interested to know if you have seen anything which addresses this concern? I feel I must be missing something because the stock price indicates that people are not concerned.

[04/06/2025, 13:11:32] Nick finegold: Very interesting and well worth monitoring . On the conference call he says that LiDAR and cameras confuse the data . That cameras are best , if there are numerous problems when full autonomy is launched even at a beta test level that will be problematic for Stark .
[04/06/2025, 13:13:40] ~ Dipesh Patel: Yes I saw the short report. Personally was VERY vague on specifics where the company has done wrong (to me). With the stakeholders it has, I would (reasonably) assume they have also had sight of the financials / revenue recognition approach the company takes. But not without risk as only recently IPO'd
[04/06/2025, 13:15:19] ~ wesley ter haar: he’s been wrong quite regularly though on what LLM’s would be able to do, this is a famous one (https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1d5ns1z/yann_lecun_confidently_predicted_that_llms_will/), and know we have VEO3, which according to him would have been impossible.

CGN Mining released a new pricing mechanism for the off-take agreement (2026-28) with its parent company.
Under the new mechanism, the proportion of fixed pricing will be reduced to 30% from 40% currently.
Most importantly, the fixed price in 2026E is set at US$94.22/lb (with +4.1% increment per year in 2027E/28E to $98.10 & $102.10), which is way higher than the US$61.78/lb in 2023 (with annual increment of 3.5% in 2024/25) under the current mechanism  vs current spot of $70.38 and term of $80.

[05/06/2025, 10:30:01] ~ William Nutting: WISE: Nutstuff has used this as a customer religiously for 4+ yrs.   
Another break-out to new all time Highs on the news that WISE is planning to move to a dual listing in London & US. 
WISE exists as the very inverse of Dick Turpins cousins in most airports and Banks when dealing with Foreign exchange! ( picture below!) Banks and others foreign exchange charges are a massive hidden tax on SME’s and individuals. Customers of WISE save @2% per transaction on  WISE.   
I see commentary out there that Wise could achieve a valuation 8x its current market cap if was U.S.-listed! Wise specialises in low-cost, transparent cross-border payments, processing £118.5 billion in transactions in FY24 and saving customers £1.8 billion compared to banks. (Honestly HOW can big banks allow themselves to have their lunch eaten like this?!!!) U.S. peers like PayPal and Block offer broader services (e.g., domestic payments, merchant services), but Wise’s focus on cross-border transfers (3.5% of a $26 trillion market) suggests significant growth potential. Wise’s partnerships with BlackRock, Monzo, and Google Pay via Wise Platform enhance its scalability, unlike some U.S. peers reliant on direct-to-consumer models.Wise faces competition from Revolut, WorldRemit, and U.S. players like PayPal and Western Union. However, its lower fees (83–90% cheaper than banks) and transparency give it an edge. ‎<This message was edited>

[05/06/2025, 12:25:01] ~ KC Shetty: It was in a range of about 28 to 35 $ for about a year. As such, a proper breakout implies a minimum of 7 + 35 = 42 , in about 6 months, ie half the time.  

The 50$ Hunt Brother level of the 1990s, was hit after some 15 years in 2011, when Gold hit about 2k. It does feel the beta play on Gold is silver, though central banks who are the drivers of Gold are unlikely to be interested in Silver. In any case,  reckon this is the last opportunity in our life time, for Silver to challenge the 50$ level. ‎<This message was edited>

[05/06/2025, 21:07:52] ~ Jonny Haycock: Apologies but one more comment from me on silver. Just got this positioning colour from someone I consider excellent in the mkt so thought I’d share…..bottom line is the trade is NOT crowded at all….
“ETFs have added 26mn oz YTD (moderately decent inflows) with COT flows uninteresting. Together net COT + ETFs hold 900mn oz (peak 1.2mn oz in 2021/22) highlighting both relative & historical neutral-to-underinvested speculative community.
Golds large ‘big break’ signaling a new cycle was roughly at $2000/oz, after which it ran 70% in 18months. If $35/oz is the $2000 equivalent, similar new bull cycle takes Silver to $70/oz but likely before 18months (given relative smaller mkt size)
Silver weekly close tomorrow, following the NFP,  is critical. $35 needs to hold to maintain momentum”. Let’s see where we are tomorrow night.

If in two years its up 45%, you get back 18.5% plus your capital.
If its down you get back 100%.

Please ping me if you want more information. 🙏🏼

[06/06/2025, 21:02:35] ~ SSCOOK: For those looking for a timely opportunity in an out favor idiosyncratic stock, in an under-owned sector then you should have a look at Unite Group (UTG LN). UTG is a one of kind hard asset play the U.K. property sector as the most liquid option (> £5bn market cap) for investing in the UK student housing property sector. 

1.. What makes it a timely idea? Is the announcement yesterday of their non-binding > £ 700 mil takeover bid for Empiric Student Property (ESP LN) a smaller listed player. Empiric has agreed to open the books to UTG, who has until July 3rd to make a formal offer or not.  The deal would expand UTG’s base of beds by 13% and the size of its portfolio by 18%. By my math the deals terms have been structured so this NTA neutral for UTG before any synergy assumptions are included. All in it values ESP LN @ a <10% discount to NTA and at today’s prices implies a take-out price of >105 or only + 2% from ESP LN’s close today. So the play here is clearly on the UTG side as bigger/better niche hard asset play and ESP brings to UTG some interesting student assets to the table (post grad initiative) and offers a lot of capital recycling optionality for UTG to monetize. 

2. Out of favor - pretty much describes the European property sector as a whole which has massively underperformed  (SX86P -1% vs SX5E +57% and FTSE 250 +14%) since ECB/BOE started raising rates in July 2022. UTG has been much worse than the SX86P (-21% since July 2022) and has been de-rated by 30-50%(depending on valuation metric) from the multiples it traded on prior to the central bank tightening cycles kicking off. This is despite UTG delivering +10% CGR cash earnings in the past 3 years (22-24). UTG trades 0.8x NTA (ex DPS), > 5.4% FFO yield, offers 4.5% dividend yield. 

3. Strong fundamentals - UTG has a lot of idiosyncratic levers at its disposal to create value: an attractive portfolio (Russell Group, London Uni assets); profitable leases (nomination contracts, CPI/RPI linkers); a new development angle in 2026-28 (adds +12% beds); a strong recapitalized balance sheet (18% LTV, ICR >6x); receding utility cost headwinds; two key JV’s - one with GIC as their partner; and a new CEO from January 2024.

4. Macro tailwind turning point ? Elevated interest rate levels remain a dark cloud over real estate sector sentiment in EUR/UK. Much of this headwind is already priced in and UTG has passed the worst of the portfolio adverse MTM from cap rate expansion in 2023 and 2024. This leaves embedded upside risk if the UK 5 year swap rates can make a healthy move back well below the 4% level (currently 4.10%). This is the key top-down catalyst that will tempt the generalists to pile back in! 

5. Stalled UK UNI biz? There has been a lot of chatter about subdued  1-3% in student growth #’s (both Brits and international) for UK unis. Lots of negative news-flow on this. Seems pretty well flagged UTG’s within in the 97%-98% occupancy expectations and this is where UTG having 93% of its beds in Russell Groups Unis kicks in. What Trump is doing to international students who want to come to college in the US has to be somewhat helpful for the UK Unis…impact TBD.  

6. Student housing structural growth opportunity  - longer term fundaments of the student housing property market are pretty favorable - with constrained supply and the opportunity to form JV partnerships with the Unis who are poor property landlords but yet still control 45% of the PBSA supply. This is who UTG is targeting for future value creation - like the 2k bed JV they have done in Newcastle already. UTG is projecting a ~ 7.3% YOC on this Uni JV vs 5.1% for existing portfolio! Watch this space.

[07/06/2025, 14:23:27] ~ Robin Maxwell: Noteworthy as a sign money returning to the property theme is the recent performance of Supermarket Income REIT (SUPR - one of my core portfolio holdings) which during Covid traded at a premium to NAV only to fall to a near 30% discount by early 2025. That has now reduced to ca 7% discount over past three months as interest rates fell but even here prospective dividend yield is around 7%. There has been similar recovery in some other REITs although interestingly big daddies of the sector like Vonovia in Germany have not followed through after an initial recovery in 2024. I suspect capital growth from here at SUPR may become trickier without an NAV re-rating but the yield is still highly attractive for those looking for income. Thanks for the Unite idea - will look in that further.

[09/06/2025, 11:18:36] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Having owned UBS stock throughout the years of capital build up post gfc, I can sympathise with the view. An over-restrictive regulatory framework for European banks has been one of the main (but def not the only) reasons for the u/p of European banks and for the u/p of European economies post gfc.
[09/06/2025, 11:21:11] ~ Mossy: Our take. Today's information comes at the more draconian end of our expectations though
primarily in the form of capital that can be used to meet requirements to cover foreign subsidiaries
as well as the non-alignment of DTA treatment with international practice. We do not see an
immediate impact on distributions (UBS has confirmed its commitment to $2bn of share buybacks
in respect of H2 + 10% increase in ordinary DPS). In the absence of mitigating actions and all else
equal, on our calculations, to meet a 17% group CET1 by, say, end 2027, our estimated '24-'27
buybacks would fall from $16.5bn to $8.0bn. Ultimately, this would not change the investment case
on UBS as it is predicated more on ROTE improvement and a corresponding re-rating, as opposed
to accretion to per share metrics from buybacks.

For me his Starlink program is potentially , along with drones, the most interesting as ultimately control of “space” is undisputedly all conquering..

I asked Chat GPT a question about control of space.. this is their response..

“What someone with control over global satellites could potentially do:
	1.	Surveillance & Intelligence
	•	Monitor global activity (military, economic, environmental).
	•	Track objects in orbit (space situational awareness).
	2.	Communication Control
	•	Influence or disrupt communication networks (internet, GPS, TV, etc.).
	•	Impact global navigation and positioning systems.
	3.	Military/Strategic Advantage
	•	Use satellites for early warning systems, missile guidance, or coordination.
	•	Jam or disable adversary satellites (if they have anti-satellite capabilities).

🚀 Summary

Someone with control over a significant number of global satellites could influence Earth-based activities heavily, especially in communication, surveillance, and military strategy. But controlling space — in the broader sense — is far beyond just having satellite dominance.

[10/06/2025, 16:31:35] ~ JB: IonQ buying Oxford Ionics for $1.1bn all in stock ex $10m of cash. 

OI has the best failure rate within quantum computing. 

OI presented at the Lansdowne Partners Investor Day, they have the best failure rates in the market which makes a massive difference when you scale QC to 256qubits.

$850bn TAM vs $9bn mkt cap. 

I think this will be seen as a game changer for both companies which you can now buy. IONQ US

[10/06/2025, 16:36:24] ~ Robin Maxwell: Bought a few today. Interestingly all but $10m being delivered in IonQ stock. If I read it correctly IonQ making two further acquisitions at same time and infer both being purchased with new shares. I have asked my Lansdowne contact to ascertain whether shares coming with any lock up or not and if so for whom? Not yet heard… I know nothing about Quantum but if Wall St as impressed as I was when listening to Oxford Ionics at Lansdowne day, then I can imagine a surge of interest as they get acquainted.

MSTR gets huge focus in US but I still want to own ALTBG FP alongside it; which is Europes “MSTR/ STRATEGY”. 
2 NEW KEY developments in the last 24hrs: 
1. Now with an OTC/US 🇺🇸ticker = $BCHXF. 
2. ⁠NOW with a capital raising ability of €10BN approved YESTERDAY by over 95% of shareholders. 
3. ⁠The stock is @$5.00 could just as easily be $50….
A reminder: A Market cap of just over €600M with nearly 1,500 Bitcoin on the balance sheet + infinitely replicable Bitcoin denominated bonds.  A €300M ATM Metaplanet/Evo Fund style to be used within 6 months by Tobam (A long term strategic investor).
  
This is a must watch. 
Please dont roll your eyes:“Marmite Mike” Saylor & Jordan Peterson. Totally fascinating on much much more than BITCOIN.  If one take-away: "Successful tech investing is backing something everyone needs, no one can stop, and few truly understand." — Michael Saylor

https://x.com/bitcoinnewscom/status/1932195123875528878?s=61

Then just think about this: under FASB accounting rules that with a Bitcoin price of $108,500, Saylors MSTR is sitting on $14.3 Billion of EBITDA Earnings in Q2 2025. If the $108k BTC price holds, $14B of net income is greater than the last quarterly net income of all US companies with the exception of the top 6 Public Companies. It is 35x $TSLA's last quarter earnings, 67x $PLTR's last quarter earnings and 3x $WMT's last quarter earnings. If Bitcoin closes Q2 at or above $119,000 Strategy will be reporting the LARGEST Quarterly earnings EVER in human history . 

*** Finally a reminder that BITCOIN is the largest single asset weight in the Nutstuff Portfolio but Digital is ‘only’ @25% weight.

[11/06/2025, 08:43:09] ~ Jim: MilDef AB -SEK 203 stocks been weak following a sale of shares from CEO. Nothing sinister here so great opportunity . 
Stocks operating in a bit of an information vacuum. Very poorly covered
and the IR is on holiday 🙂. 
Managed to get hold of him though . He stated ‘ nothing changed in our development  - on July 18th we release exciting numbers . For us its all business as (un) normal (considering the strong growth growth rate and prospects) - we run a thriving company. Interesting use of words here. 
Forecasts too low, one broker has way too much fade on the numbers. In companies words they tend to lag the early defence expenditure given their product. IT Systems tend to be last into military hardware. So I would expect an acceleration in growth not slowing. Margin forecast also too low. Currently 15% but should go north of 20% in 3 years. Stock sitting on 20 x  current forecast FY 26. Company expects many years of high growth 25%  + so they 4x capacity in 2024. Pure play on European defence in the right product area . Digital and IT .  Hopefully get them on Club call post results.

[11/06/2025, 14:53:18] ~ Rich McDonald: Smarter Web Company (SWC .Q) +25% today on its US listing. That makes it +55% week to date.
[11/06/2025, 15:03:32] ~ William Nutting: Great job.
[11/06/2025, 15:20:06] ~ Ben Finegold: On SMR / OKLO…

I think the club thesis on being short was right but as ever timing…

Both stocks up 15-20% today…

These are now $10bn market cap companies that are pre revenue, will not deliver revenues until 2030+, Oklo does not have a license to generate nuclear power…they have gone way too far imo.

Am not long / short either of them but would be tempted to be short at these levels. If broader markets turn these are the companies that can fall 25% in a day ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/2025, 15:23:12] ~ William Nutting: I’d be so careful. Just SO little mkt cap in Uranium and so many needing and wanting to get jnto the room… hear you on fundamentals. LTBR and ASPI short posns still excites
[11/06/2025, 15:24:12] ~ Ben Finegold: Agree but I am thinking how much MORE positive can US nuclear get than it currently is?
[11/06/2025, 15:25:10] ~ Ben Finegold: To be clear I do not feel the same way about a lot of the rest of the sector as they will deliver revenues soon / already do. But those two names in particular I think I’d avoid for the time being.
[11/06/2025, 16:07:48] ~ Richard Windsor: Ouster. OUST.US. Up strongly on qualifying with the US government as a lidar supplier.  Iahve had a $20 target for ages and its mow there. Will review the numbers and revert with a view
[11/06/2025, 16:09:18] ~ Ben Finegold: Rich do you have any indication on what being on the DOD approved list means in terms of volumes / sales?
[11/06/2025, 16:10:00] ~ Ben Finegold: They mention in the PR that being on this list allows the technology to be deployed “rapidly” but not sure if this is just sales talk or whether units will actually now be deployed
[11/06/2025, 16:18:18] ~ KC Shetty: Ouster has been in a 10$ range for over a year now. A genuine breakout implies a target of 16+ 10= 26$ in half the time ie 6 months. 

That should be clear in 1 week, if the gap up today at  17.18 is not seen in the coming week, indicating that all profit booking is absorbed by fresh buyers.
[11/06/2025, 16:27:26] ~ Dipesh Patel: I think that's the whole sector. Not 1 stock in my view, is close to generating enough profit to substantiate performance. These are all plays on the future. Even ASPI. When the theme is strong and/or newsflash supportive it's not worth standing in the way. If the newsflow abates, they will all come off. It's been a momentum sector in recent sessions. I've sold all exposure to the nuclear theme (probably a mistake as it's always worth keeping something if you think the structural shift continues) but tied with very easy/supportive markets I can live with that. In general, we are getting into red flag territory a bit. Lots of cheap stocks out there, and I'm trying to avoid making a market call, but always concerning when your uber driver starts chatting about defense stocks or Uranium 😉
[11/06/2025, 16:28:14] ~ Richard Windsor: None at all but it could be meaningful and at high margin

[11/06/2025, 16:54:44] Nick finegold: I bought back into Ouster at the start of the trading session . 

If Jonas is adding $100-1000 for Tesla on drones that suggests the enormity of the market. 

No doubt Tesla will probably  make their own but there will be many suppliers that don’t . I also think it’s enormous validation for them as a supplier vs their peers

ATOME/ ATOM LN: (Credit to Nick F & Curation for the flag and expect to see them work their magic here).  

2 PITCHES:

1. THE CURATION ATOME  /ATOM LN SHAREFLIX showcase is worth a look: https://app.curationconnect.com/company/Atome-71605?utm_source=whatsapp_atome

2. The NUTSTUFF PITCH: 
A co. Of 14 PEOPLE. @$29m. CEO Olivier Mussat.  Listed in 2021. Peaked at $70m mkt cap. They just signed a $465m contract. The cynics will legitimately say:  “Wondering why it’s being pushed now.  Has it got all the permits? Environmental / Water. It needs $500m of capex to fund and the EV is $550m and ebitda is year 5 @$85m.” I say YES to alot of this but its the mkt cap it is for reason! 
A few things: BALANCE SHEET:  $3-$4M. In 5yrs I could see $500m Equity value. Largest Hydrogen Fund “HY24” is investing into project 1. CAVEAT: It is TINY!!! Free float of $7-8m. Can I see a path from 56p to £2? YES There is covereage, my friend GrantB and his team at SP Angel cover it. Some truly interesting things however: Shares issued at 30% Premium to management 2 weeks ago. Their prodn is <1% of YARA. Project developer.  Like SHELL who want to de-carbonise: Project no.1 CASALE with no green premium should make $70m ebitda. Plant is running in 3 yrs time. In year 4 on todays Fertiliser price:  $110m revenue =$70m ebitda @20% = $14/15m Ebitda. FUNDING: Debt 12-14% yrs <3%:  $400m and $230m Equity. Whats fascinating when speaking with Management is: 1. They saw this before anyone else. They dont see this as an LNG export world. 2. The Old companies like YARA & CF Industries etc have built nothing since the 1990’s. 3. The Fertiliser sector is very tough. Nitrogen Fertiliser. No2 is 300x more pollutant than co2 40% china emissions from synthetic nitrogen. Massive issues. EM cant afford synthetic nitrogen and much of it is powdered building rubble. Sri Lanka have banned nitrogen ferts. Malawi agricultural yields are -40%.  Who cares? Think NESPRESSO: 1% price ⬆️ for 40% less Carbon imput. Think PEPSICO now signing with YARA. Simply put: YARA needs a co. Like ATOM. All power for ATOME is from 100% renewable sources and all chosen sites are located close to the power and water sources and export facilities to serve significant domestic and then international demand. The Company has an interesting green-focused Board which is supported by major shareholders including Peter Levine, Schroders, a leading fund manager, and Baker Hughes, a global technology company operating in the energy and industry sectors.
[11/06/2025, 19:50:50] ~ Ben Finegold: Have got to know the Hy24 guys over the last few months. They are super smart investors. Run by the ex CEO of Air Liquide Pierre Etienne Franc. If they’re involved usually a good sign.

[12/06/2025, 08:46:33] ~ William Nutting: So, WPP; “A MASSIVE WHAT IF”?!  How about a Digital Pivot?!
As WPP's CEO exits, a lot of folks either forget and/or dismiss the withering and sunset of AppNexus/Xandr. A massive acquisition of tech that was supposed to be a known entity (ad tech) but as they are finding out, AI is a wildly different animal.  It will be fascinating to see how this plays out.
WPP is a lumbering legacy advertising group with ~$15B in annual revenue, but structurally under threat from:
	•	In-housing of creative/media functions
	•	The dominance of Google/Facebook’s ad platforms
	•	AI commoditizing creative production
	•	Margin erosion from consultancy competition (Accenture Song, etc.)
Sacking Mark Read signals the board knows incrementalism isn’t working. So here’s the radical BTC treasury thesis, spelled out: BLUE-SKY THINKING:

How about a Simple Digital Pivot Thesis?: From Ad Conglomerate to Bitcoin Treasury Vehicle: WPP becomes a publicly listed Bitcoin holding and infrastructure company, using its remaining free cash flow, asset sales, and balance sheet strength to rotate fully into BTC.
Mechanics:
	•	Step 1: Fire sale of legacy ad units / roll-up non-core subsidiaries
	•	Step 2: Reallocate proceeds + cash flows into BTC
	•	Step 3: Signal a Saylor-style “never sell BTC” strategy
	•	Step 4: Rebrand as a capital-efficient holding vehicle for the Bitcoin economy (Bitcoin media, Bitcoin infra, etc.)
Rationale:
	•	The market rewards BTC-aligned equities with extreme mNAV premiums (MSTR, Metaplanet, ALTBG)
	•	WPP has brand and balance sheet optionality
	•	Being early to the “advertising is obsolete, digital hard money is the brand” thesis gives it cult-like backing
Outcome:
	•	WPP becomes the first FTSE-listed BTC treasury company
	•	Re-rates from 5–7x EBITDA to 1.5–3x BTC-per-share premium
	•	Institutional demand from UK investors unable to buy raw BTC but able to buy listed BTC proxy.
[12/06/2025, 08:46:36] ~ Luke Dyas: BYD is already turning solid profits in EVs while outcompeting everyone on price and scale. The same story is likely to play out in humanoid robots and mass-market drones, China dominates both supply chains and again will undercut. Anyone have favourite humanoid robot plays beyond Tesla? I hold Harmonic Drive Systems (6324 JP), which makes precision torque motors for robots, but keen to find other names.
[12/06/2025, 08:55:41] Nick finegold: I need to check this out but humanoid robots use a combination of sensors lidars and cameras to interact with the world so I am wondering if lidar and ouster are exposed to that world as well as drones .

[12/06/2025, 09:20:46] ~ Luke Dyas: The BTC treasury trade (still my biggest long) works because of scarcity, only a few public names hold BTC, so they get rewarded with big NAV premiums. But once the bandwagon gets crowded, those premiums vanish, especially if the core business is deteriorating.
My concern with WPP is that, while they’re admirably confronting innovator’s dilemma, the fat-margin, high-retainer, gatekeeper era is already over. They’re at risk of full disintermediation, tech or no tech. Clients now have access to generalist AI tools priced in tokens, eventually converging toward the cost of electricity.

According to Barron’s it is the clear leader today - https://www.barrons.com/articles/nuclear-energy-stocks-aa86ca8f

Ownership stakes differ by region: In Japan, Hitachi holds 80%, GE owns 20%; In the U.S., GE holds 60%, Hitachi 40%.

Either way that is a significant exposure to the US nuclear/SMR roll out. It’s already booking ¥160 billion (~USD 1.4 billion) in revenue from its nuclear power business in Japan (FY 2023); and able to leverage 8 years of experience working with GE to execute successfully. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/06/2025, 11:50:07] Nick finegold: Safety
Waymo regularly publishes safety reports.[132] Waymo is required by the California DMV to report the number of incidents where the safety driver took control for safety reasons. Some incidents were not reported when simulations indicated that the car would have stopped safely on its own.[133] In 2023, Waymo claimed only 3 crashes with injuries over 7.1 million miles driven, nearly twice as safe as a human driver.[134] A 2025 peer-reviewed study by Waymo researchers found that collisions with bicycles and motorcycles were 82% less frequent for Waymo cars than for human drivers, and that collisions with pedestrians were 92% less frequent.[135]

[12/06/2025, 11:57:44] ~ William Nutting: All; alot of feedback on my WPP “What if” thesis…
A good chat with George at Sycamore Gap this morning and we have put together some what I think are good Structural thoughts on this and also why WPP has the best 50 people in the world to execute a BTC T company.
“BTC Treasury Companies: The New Elite Performance Teams”.
A taster: “In the new and emerging hard money era, BTC treasury companies are not just financial entities. They are becoming high-performance teams, more akin to F1 crews or top-flight football clubs than traditional corporates. The mission? Outperform the market by accumulating Bitcoin faster and more efficiently than anyone else. Performance is the only KPI.”….

If anyone wants more lets me know and anyone at WPP happy to come and chat!

Ukraine's defense industry says the fight against Russia has shown it that the West's approach to weapons is wrong
By Sinéad Baker
Jun 11, 2025, 10:47 AM BST
A Ukrainian industry rep has said the West is approaching weaponry for major conflicts the wrong way.
Countries need a lot of pretty good weapons instead of only a handful of excellent ones, he said.
It's a warning that industry officials, experts, and some European defense ministers have echoed.
Ukraine's defense industry is urging the West to abandon its longtime fixation on high-end, expensive weaponry in favor of cheaper, mass-produced arms, the kind needed to survive and win a grinding war of attrition against an adversary like Russia.
[12/06/2025, 16:13:04] ~ William Nutting: Nick very true. The baton to New Future defense from the legacy platform wedded is going to be fascinating..

Because ouster has $1bn market cap with -$100m of sales . Valeo has €1bn of lidar sales with a 2.5bn market cap . We are investigating ‎<This message was edited>

[15/06/2025, 18:35:55] ~ Jerry de Leeuw: On another note:

What to think of Atos SE (ditigital transformation and IT services)? I’d say strongly undervalued considering the following:

Their reorganisational Genesis transformation plan which is to be finalised in 2027. 

After been hit hard, financials (expected) recover. Reverse stock split in 2023. Mergers possible in 2026, 2027. ‘Payment’ pergaps in stock. Likely to buy back shares. Their stock buy back programme (approved last week; see doc. below) allows them to buy up to a share price of 100 euro (current price 36-ish).

Next, (expected) eps: 15.00 euro

Furthermore, the (how unrealistic?) IPCEI-programme (the EU to build its own cloud to mitigate US dependency) is executed by 19 firms, including Atos.

Etcetera, etc. 

Disclaimer:
I own a small position but will start buying this week unless someone convinces me to have overlooked significant aspects.

If you think we’re going back to $100/lb uranium - that’s not going to happen today - worth holding onto these for sure.
[16/06/2025, 08:39:39] Nick finegold: Stablecoin hype has reached a fever pitch with flurry of news late last week with SHOP, WMT, and AMZN all beginning to make moves. These two developments mark the first real major strategic move (or at least major action being considered) by the three most significant merchants in the US with direct aim at V & MA. We view 2021 as a relevant example for how the stocks can act when there is a perceived threat to the moats. While V & MA consistently beat/raised over the course of FY21, both stocks were ~flat for the year.
[16/06/2025, 08:42:34] Nick finegold: Maybe the most compelling argument for BTC is that the golden rule of any business is to make yourself easy to pay.

[16/06/2025, 10:00:52] ~ Rich McDonald: I think I’ve got a video which explains the methodology (don’t shoot the messenger!) but essentially;  
- Mkt cap starts small with some bitcoin enthusiasts happy to buy stock at a 10x multiple to what the assets will be… because let’s be honest - crypto investors don’t really pay attention to any fundamentals anyway 
- In the early days, sub £100m mkt cap, ⁠this allows the company to do raise after raise at a 7-10x multiple of their bitcoin +cash holdings (MNAV). 
- ⁠because they issue equity at such high multiples, shareholders only get diluted by 7% whereas the MNAV increases by 30-50% 
- ⁠This means what seems like a crazy multiple now 10:1, quickly becomes a 1:1 mkt cap to Bitcoin within a matter of weeks and then in theory continues to grow like Metaplanet (>$5bln) or obvs Strategy
- ⁠As the market cap grows in theory the Premium to MNAV should come in… 6x , 5x , 3x but the market is still pricing in confidence that it’s early days, hence the 9x still on SWC as he has managed to get listed in the US now as well.
[16/06/2025, 10:04:54] ~ Rich McDonald: That’s the reason they are buying these treasury models instead of just Bitcoin - but then you had the added intricacies of BTC going up, and bringing in Convertible debt into the picture - which is why Strategy is so genius. 
Being short Fiat debt versus Long leveraged, compounding BTC.
[16/06/2025, 10:10:39] ~ Rich McDonald: Risk warning:
It trades on Aquis - and when people end up wanting out of this thing, there won’t be any bids and it will look horrific. 
Risks: Multiple compression, Bitcoin dropping, any real small cap risk off,  any FCA commentary on the treasury model or a bit more left field: if there was any unknown limit to how much you can raise in a certain time period without a prospectus.
[16/06/2025, 10:30:44] ~ Chris Huggins: Thanks Rich. It is exactly as I thought. A scary, but an honest articulation of a “greater fool” strategy. 

The bet is that the stock rallies , they then raise say £100mm from other valuation agnostic investors at a slightly lower premium (say 5x to the post raise holding of Bitcoin) 

As you say, this stock won’t trade on any gap down….so a somewhat terrifying “valley of death” to cross before the premium normalises. 

Given there is zero moat to this strategy, it feels safer to wait and back the next listed entity who wants to raise equity at a (more modest) premium whilst identifying themselves as a bitcoin treasury player? (Providing the universe of valuation agnostic buyers haven’t all been exhausted/stopped out) ‎<This message was edited>

It is a means to bet on two strong trends at once: 1) the ongoing recovery in the European space launches in a context of a global "space race"; and 2) the expected boom in defence spending, with specific reference to the strategic Air Defence domain. We have improved 2025-27 EPS estimates by an average ~29%: Avio offers a ~0.67x PEG, well below the median ~1.65x of the peers, suggesting material upside".

[16/06/2025, 17:14:27] ~ Ben Finegold: We sent the following to clients this morning:

On Iran: Its uranium inventory, conversion and enrichment capacity is inconsequential to global supply/demand. However, we are monitoring the situation from a nuclear proliferation perspective:

Iran’s relationship with the IAEA has significantly deteriorated. Despite remaining a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the IAEA  has formally declared Iran in breach of its obligations for the first time since 2005. This follows Tehran’s refusal to clarify the presence of undeclared nuclear material and its broader lack of cooperation with inspectors. In response to the IAEA’s resolution, Iran has announced it will cease sharing information on nuclear protection measures, effectively curtailing international oversight. At the same time, its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% has risen by nearly 50%, reported to be 400kg, reaching levels sufficient for multiple nuclear weapons if further enriched. 

It is now being reported that Iran’s parliament is considering withdrawal from nuclear proliferation treaty. 

This significantly raises the risk of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has openly indicated it would seek a nuclear deterrent if Iran crosses the threshold, while Israel may accelerate its strategic posture. Other regional powers like Turkey and Egypt could also reassess their long-term security strategies in response, increasing the likelihood of horizontal proliferation.

We believe the situation is likely to encourage strategic, state-sponsored stockpiling of enriched uranium, particularly among regional powers looking to hedge without formally breaching the NPT. Civil nuclear programs, which can be framed as energy diversification, offer a credible cover for building dual-use infrastructure that can quickly shift from civilian to military applications if needed. At the same time, established nuclear states may bolster its forward reserves or fuel capabilities to reinforce deterrence.

[17/06/2025, 06:34:53] ~ Andrew Draycott: For those interested, I attended the jaguar Land Rover investor day at Gaydon yesterday. Owned by tata it’s not a company I own but I’m interested in their strategy.

Key points
GBP is hurting them, and hedges roll off shortly.
Cash flow is about to hit zero.
Ebit margins are half ebitda.
Capex is still £4bn on 28bn of revenue.
They imo are at peak product cycle.
Tariffs are just a problem, they cap volumes too.

Lastly they appear to want to be the lvmh of cars, and believe they can charge more for BEVs than ICEs because they have better performance metrics. I don’t personally see how, given the deflationary dynamic from Tesla and byd, but time will tell.

Great product, superb engineering, but imho not making any roce in the next few years, and highly challenged in China, where 250 models out of 1000 are dropping prices. 

They are bringing back the free lander there to grow volume

[17/06/2025, 14:05:04] ~ Dipesh Patel: As a chess enthusiast, this caught my eye. For those that are skeptical of the ability of LLMs or their uses, there is some ammo for you here in terms of current limitations ....
[17/06/2025, 14:06:05] ~ Robin Maxwell: For Leonardo S.p.A. (the listed Italian defence and aerospace giant), the Cyber & Security Solutions division generated approximately €648 million in revenues for the full 2024 fiscal year—a 9% increase over 2023  (source ChatGPT). The CEO said Acc Reuters that no single deal would cost more than 15% of Cybersecurity div turnover - which suggests buying a privately held company not a listed cybersecurity name.
[17/06/2025, 14:07:26] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Sophos got bought about 4y ago and Darktrace last year. Also have in mind Thales who, apart from the core defence business, are growing in cybersec, they bought Imperva 18mo ago. Small part but with national sensitivities growing, should benefit.

The Daily Telegraph: Rachel Reeves is considering reversing an inheritance tax raid on non-doms amid mounting evidence that it has sparked an exodus of the wealthy.
[18/06/2025, 05:58:43] Nick finegold: It’s been a disaster
‎[18/06/2025, 07:46:43] ~ David Haysey: ‎image omitted
[18/06/2025, 07:55:44] ~ Robin Maxwell: I met with former CEO of well known US Investment bank last week - a resident non-dom worth “hundreds of millions of $$$”. Seems the exodus is only one part of the problem, the bigger issue he was explaining is that 1/10th of 1% of UK UHNW’s (many resident non-doms) contribute 9% of all tax revenues but have their assets all locked up in trusts / similar vehicles and cannot/will not risk unwinding anything with Ms Reeves / HMRC waiting like tax hawks for any chink in their armour. So much capital not available to UK plc… that’s the even bigger disaster.
[18/06/2025, 07:59:00] ~ Stretch: Every single one of my clients has left the country in the last two years. In addition I’m currently completing a chair person role for a very large consumer company and all three of the potential candidates are people who used to live in the UK until very recently. One is in Milan another is in Monaco and another in Connecticut. This is a massive disaster for the UK.
[18/06/2025, 07:59:33] ~ GR: Another volte face from the current Government 

Incredible to think Labour only finally sunk its teeth into non dom status after 200+ years, after Sunak announced its dismantling 

Most non doms for who it is an issue are already long gone, from the atrong anecdotal evidence I have
[18/06/2025, 07:59:54] ~ Stretch: The entrepreneurial capital and talent that has gone he’s gonna have significant impacts for this country, and we should remember that this was Jeremy Hunt not Rachael Reeves

Thought this was relevant to the WPP discussion: a Baidu e-commerce livestream featured two AI avatars co-hosting a 6-hour stream. Powered by Baidu’s ERNIE model, it had 13mn views, generated $8mn GMV, and significantly outsold the real human the avatars were modeled on.
This is real-time, reactive, hyper-personalized engagement. No fatigue, no downtime, and unlimited scalability.
Legacy agencies still think in terms of talent/media buying/campaign cycles. AI-native players operate on models/latency/data flywheels. That difference is only accelerating.
WPP’s TikTok Symphony partnership might seem forward-looking, but it's still built around roles that are on the verge of being fully replaced by integrated creative and deployment tools. I'm just not convinced WPP is even going to be in the same race. Hopefully they get a tech native CEO in next year but it could be too little too late.

Again, worth re-iterating that its clear now that the new meme is BTC treasury assets. Certain returns allre clearly short term madness! It’s a seminal moment in the history of finance in my view, capital markets securitising BTC.

“While maintaining a lean cost structure, Ouster is targeting 30-50% annual revenue growth and gross margins of 35-40%. The company has met or exceeded its guidance for nine consecutive quarters. Revenue is roughly evenly split among automotive, industrial, robotics, and smart infrastructure with notable clients such as John Deere, Komatsu, Motional, May Mobility, Forterra, and Serve Robotics. Ouster has $171M cash on hand as of 3/31 and burned ~$37M in 2025. Ouster’s consistent revenue growth and healthy gross margins puts them on a path to profitability, with a focus on maintaining healthy gross margins.”

[20/06/2025, 08:53:24] ~ William Nutting: Many of you may have been well Raoul’d last night. 
I bet NF was a brilliant Master of Ceremonies.
Raoul has built a heck of a machine and it is still sooo early…

Just on the ongoing thematic of BITCOIN CUSTODY. 
Nutstuff has a NEW toy to play with and its UK 🇬🇧 LISTED. ( see below) And it sits well alongside ALTBG FP & METAPLANET.

To illustrate a point on this soace in general: 

A Friday Thought for the day: 

Someone sent me this:
“ so, let me get this straight: You put 70% of your portfolio in a Japanese hotel company, that owns 1 hotel and is capitalised on 10000 virtual internet coins, trading at 7x its net asset value?" 
(METAPLANET/3350 JT +400% ytd/ 300% QTD to $7.4bn)
Yup thats right Dave! 

Nutstuff can re-purpose this to clarify for Dave!!!

“Let me get this straight. You took a sleepy Japanese hotel company, reverse-engineered it into a Bitcoin holding vehicle, exploited one of the most advantageous tax codes in the G7, avoided capital gains on BTC, gained regulatory clarity from the FSA, bought 10,000 coins, and now you’re trading at a 7x NAV premium?”
“That’s right, Dave. It’s not just a hotel anymore it’s a Bitcoin embassy with room service.”
“And the founders?”
“Two guys, one from a fintech hedge fund, the other fluent in Japanese law and memetics. They weaponised jurisdictional arbitrage like it was a family office sport.”
“So, yes. no debt, full BTC backing, equity float, tax shield, public listing, and liquidity?”
“You’re catching on, Dave. It’s like Berkshire Hathaway starting in a Tokyo business hotel with a cold wallet.”
Oh and anyone wanting to know the latest UK version of this..?! 

Then a new Idea:  Vinanz / BTC LN. Listed on the LSE + am seeing a potential Nasdaq listing, also is rebranding to “London bitcoin company”
I think this is a very unique ticker and I think about the interesting operational arbitrage of mining meeting custody.
[20/06/2025, 09:01:31] ~ Tim Sykes: Brilliant evening. Raoul was pretty amazing. Although I am sure he is wrong about Stephen Bartlett.
[20/06/2025, 09:33:15] ~ Paul Dewinter: Thank you, Nick, for putting on such a great event — fantastic location and atmosphere.
Also, a big thanks to Hope and the team for handling all the logistics and keeping us well-watered!!!
Raoul Pal covered so many fascinating topics and left us all with plenty to think about — I could’ve listened to him for hours.
Great to see the collective going from strength to strength — and it was nice to hear Raoul’s endorsement of all your efforts.

[20/06/2025, 10:05:13] Nick finegold: I think this is quite poorly inderstoof this side of the pond . It’s a moment when stable coins can now be used to settle and clear anything outside the banking systems.
[20/06/2025, 10:45:57] Nick finegold: By the way the more money circle makes the more money Coinbase makes . It’s the plumbing for circle.
[20/06/2025, 11:04:40] ~ Luke Dyas: Coinbase also much better hedged against interest rate declines. Most of Circle's income is interest on short-term US treasuries. If rates fall Circle's revenue collapses, as will the 50% of Circle's interest that Coinbase receives, but multiples for Coinbase's bigger trading business would expand in a low rate environment along with the rest of high beta, long duration tech.
[20/06/2025, 11:07:17] ~ Luke Dyas: Although Raoul didn't talk about it yesterday. Coinbase is the default bitcoin custodian option for BTC ETFs and BTC treasury. So its arguably the purest picks and shovels play on the BTC treasury theme.

And good TFG support.
“Heads-up”: 
AVIO joins and supports a New "European Space" Position: Eutelsat (ETL FP) is a European satellite company, one of only two global operators with active commercial LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite fleets (the other being Space-X!) as well as the largest private investor in the European IRIS² satellite program, which is critical to the EU for security. Eutelsat just announced a €1.35bn capital raise anchored by the French government and other key investors. Interestingly, the stock is at €2.90 but half the capital raise is being done at €4 i.e. the French state increased their stake and put more money at a +30% PREMIUM to current price! ETL also signed a €1bn , 10-year deal with the French army the day before. This is existential

[23/06/2025, 07:05:24] ~ Katie Jackson: 🇮🇷 *US bombing of Iran – a “cathartic event” for markets*

This is _THE_ morning to start your free subscription to _Smith Market Insight_.

Conor Smith lays out 10 facts (!) and concludes:

🧠 _“This is a cathartic event (providing psychological relief) for markets and as it becomes ever increasingly clear that Iran’s threat to the region and World has been defenestrated to probable terminal levels – investors will move on positively relatively quickly ahead”_

🔑 Key takeaways:

🌮 TACO trade = dead
🇷🇺 Russia weakened – Iran supplies its drones
😅 Weekend Middle East relief rally = telling
🤝 Turkey & Azerbaijan scrambling to realign with US
🚢 Hormuz closure threat = low capability/motivation → oil should drop
🇪🇺 Europe needs to rearmour to stay relevant

With the usual news feeds full of hysteria yesterday, I was desperate to get Conor’s email + Loom this morning.

📬 Methodical. Diligent. Clear. Conclusive.

[23/06/2025, 07:19:15] ~ Jason Mackay: I thought v interesting stat from Andressen over weekend.
Over last 100 years 60% companies destroyed value. 90% of returns have come from 2% of companies. 23 companies 0.1% are 30% of total returns. Most of these have been established in periods of great technological change.
Sadly do not have the answer but 4/5 AI related companies will probably be the bulk of stock market returns in next 5 years. 
A lot of massive stock returns like Coreweave last quarter. Feels to me like time to have much more concentrated portfolio.
[23/06/2025, 08:13:43] Nick finegold: Welcome Jason , I think the point is excellent and probably the absolute opposite of what any financial advisor would have told anyone to do, years ago. 

The growth of passive investing has no doubt played a huge part in the big getting bigger. 

Presumably passive killed active over the same time period ?

[23/06/2025, 08:24:57] ~ Robin Maxwell: M&G / Dai-Ichi Life ....M&G stock now +13% since 30/05 announcement that Dai-Ichi will take a 15% stake. Starting to flat line at this higher level. Does anyone know under UK code when and how Dai-Ichi has to report going through various thresholds. Is 5% first threshold that needs to be made public? I havn't seen any news yet -- going to check with my Japanese contacts.
[23/06/2025, 08:27:22] ~ Simon Brewer: Whilst Jason’s comments about historic returns is correct and documented by Mauboussin of Columbia Bus School  ( see Money Maze Podcast  Interview 120) there have beeen significant episodes of mean reversion from important areas of the market.  If we are on the cusp of a commodity new bull market and the signs of thiis are emerging then a concentrated portfolio of the “new” may be a poor investment choice!.
[23/06/2025, 08:30:56] ~ Jason Mackay: I am by the way not suggesting you own the Mag 7 I am more suggesting finding 5-10 companies now that are winners of the future is the key. Clearly a v obvious point. But I think the performance of recent IPOs in US+ some quite big stocks in US and Europe last few months shows market in mood to over reward these names.

Vast TAM market , in USDC, and a  $80bn market cap that offers them quite a bit of strategic flexibility to buy anything that emerges in the space that’s innovative.  A little like Facebook buying instagram and what’s app. .

Sure to be huge competition but they have the regulator onside and a real currency in their rating.

[23/06/2025, 09:15:53] ~ William Nutting: From friday! Eutelsat ..

On AVIO. Key Nutstuff position..
And good TFG support.
“Heads-up”: 
AVIO joins and supports a New "European Space" Position: Eutelsat (ETL FP) is a European satellite company, one of only two global operators with active commercial LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite fleets (the other being Space-X!) as well as the largest private investor in the European IRIS² satellite program, which is critical to the EU for security. Eutelsat just announced a €1.35bn capital raise anchored by the French government and other key investors. Interestingly, the stock is at €2.90 but half the capital raise is being done at €4 i.e. the French state increased their stake and put more money at a +30% PREMIUM to current price! ETL also signed a €1bn , 10-year deal with the French army the day before. This is existential
[23/06/2025, 10:03:39] Nick finegold: That’s very interesting. A little like Atome , the management bought in at 50p when it was at 38p and it’s now 60p. 

The French government knows what’s coming .

[23/06/2025, 10:45:07] ~ John Drinkwater: Company effectively controlled by founder(s) and constant share repurchase funded by bank facility . Legal insider buying . Would be better if monthly NAV provided by company but no incentives..
[23/06/2025, 10:45:15] ~ Robin Maxwell: Building Materials - HOLCIM spin off of Amrize to be separately listed 23/06 on SIX and NYSE.

Press Release https://www.holcim.com/media/media-releases/holcim-plans-amrize-spin-off-for-june-23 ...If anyone sees any research on Holcim v's Amerize this week - Please post.
[23/06/2025, 10:49:09] Nick finegold: Quite a few people own the stub . So I appreciate the reminder . Based on other BTC custody plays it looks ridiculously cheap but pretty unbuyable.

Nav will depend on what crypto assets they bought . So Nav will be interesting . He used to own a lot of ethereum but whether he switched will be key.

[23/06/2025, 12:21:07] Nick finegold: Pharma Stocks Dip as RFK Jr. Pushes to Rein In Drug Ads
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. wants to make it harder and more expensive for pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to patients. 
His proposals include requiring longer, more detailed risk disclosures in ads, making them costlier and less effective, and removing the tax deductibility of ad expenses for drugmakers. 
Drug advertisements work: A study from USC found that regions with higher ad exposure saw a 6% increase in prescriptions, 70% of which were new.
Pfizer and AbbVie, two of the biggest pharma advertisers, fell 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, on the news. 
RFK Jr.’s primary obstacle will be the First Amendment. U.S. courts have consistently ruled since the 1970s that commercial speech, including pharma ads, is protected. He’ll also have to fight an army of lobbyists: The pharmaceutical industry was the top spender on Capitol Hill last year, dispensing close to $400 million.
These policy changes wouldn’t just affect drugmakers: Pharma ads made up 10% to 12% of total U.S. TV ad revenue last year. Losing that spend would pressure TV networks already in decline.

 	
This would probably be the last nail in the broadcast TV industry’s coffin. Big picture, this feels like a gift to Alphabet and Meta. That $10 billion in pharma ad spend isn’t going away. It’ll just get reallocated to digital. Expect a wave of content marketing and native advertising on Instagram and YouTube. The industry will find new ways to push the same products, just with better targeting and lower CPMs. So while this might be good for public health, it’s definitely bad for cable and great for tech.
[23/06/2025, 12:43:07] ~ Luke Dyas: I've bought more Bitcoin Group SE (ADE GR) (biggest BTC NAV discount I can find). Largest BTC corporate holder in Germany but completely forgotten about (despite the name). I checked with the company today and they hold 3600 BTC and 10000 ETH. That's US$390mn just in BTC and ETH vs market cap of EUR200mn, so a 41% discount just on BTC & ETH holdings. Core business was profitable in 1H24 and they have minimal debt. Full year results coming out in the next few weeks which could put it back on the map.
[23/06/2025, 13:15:05] ~ Mark: Mark Donegan RIP always pointed out the inevitable results of ‘Diworsification’ …..and the Chandler brothers (greatest EM investors nobody has heard of) had all their money in 5 - 10 names….
[23/06/2025, 14:12:05] ~ Katie Jackson: It will be interesting to see what Roche-Zealand Pharma are able to achieve together. Zealand’s CEO very confident their Amylin the best. Roche has more therapy swimming lanes outside of just obesity which helps. I hold Zealand PA btw.

My take when broking obesity plays was that a lot of LOs who missed Novo still held Roche and the latter was making enough noise about obesity intentions by that point to not rotate. Zealand alone was too risky as really a biotech. Together it could easily be the 3rd player in obesity/possibly with the best combined GLP-1/Amylin therapy…

Would love to hear others insights…

[23/06/2025, 20:07:36] ~ William Nutting: 2 KEY THINGS IN DIGITAL ASSET WORLD: 
It maybe all be madness and many may roll their eyes at meteoric moves in Bitcoin custody but just think about 2 BILLION digital wallets globally going to 5bn + vs how many on line brokereage accnts? Interactive says 3.8 MILLION.
You CAN buy these things easily on Trading 212/ Revolut etc.  

On BITCOIN / BTC LN. After 🚀 moves. £92m mkt cap. 
1. Btc purchase coming.
2. Btc is popping up. 
3. The Bitcoin wizard/ Adam Livingstone likes the stock. 
4. USA price VINZF US is well above the UK. 
5. Watch a coming Nasdaq listing. 

On BITCOIN: This is an interesting signal worth watching: 
Yesterday/ June 22nd the BTC hashrate dropped sharply from 886m TH/s to 672m TH/s — a 24% fall in a single day. This coincided exactly with the US strike on Iran’s Fordo nuclear site using 14 bunker busters.
This Raises a legitimate question: Could there have been miners operating off Iranian nuclear power, perhaps as part of a low-AISC setup quietly supporting state revenues?
If so, it would be a textbook case of state-subsidised mining tied to geopolitical energy infrastructure. Nutstuff thinks is worth putting on this on the radar, I am not saying it’s causal, but the correlation is striking.
[23/06/2025, 20:19:01] ~ Luke Dyas: That all tallies on Iran/BTC. Iran is actually a top 10 crypto miner (3-4% of global total) and state support is well documented as a way of circumventing sanctions. Difficulty rate will readjust on June 29th to rebalance BTC mining impact.

Watch Elon ‘take over’ use the velocity of ‘X’ around the rate of change on robotaxi in terms of ability, scale, geofence, new cities, etc….. the US needs to have many stalking horses in the Military Autonomous Complex (MAC) as China is really kicking our robot ass.

[24/06/2025, 08:14:59] ~ William Nutting: As BTC LN opens up another 20%. Focus on the Mkt cap still deminimous when you think of ravenous digital wallets.

A Few thoughts on Bitcoin Treasury: 
“Owning the best Bitcoin treasury companies is like holding gold but gold that is wrapped in a shimmering mithril cloak woven from code, resistant to inflation, censorship, and clueless central bankers. It’s not just a store of value. It’s Frodo’s vest in the age of digital warfare. While others are lugging around rusty swords of fiat, you’re slipping silently through Mordor with sovereign-grade assets on your chest. And instead of Gandalf, you’ve got Saylor whispering in your ear: ‘Fly, you fools’… into cold storage.” 
Now the serious point is: 
We’re now witnessing a bifurcation in BTC treasury companies: those with deep capital markets experience, and those without.
The most effective are fusing the ethos of Bitcoiners with the structuring skills of financial engineers. These teams understand both the cryptographic hardness of Bitcoin and the leverage that comes from balance sheet optimization, convertible instruments, and secondary market signaling. It’s the fusion of community and capital, underpinned by hard money principles. That’s where the real alchemy lies.
Bitcoin is basically destroying the meme coin by becoming one through the stocks on the capital markets!
The difference being that BTC has staying power so it’s generally healthy for BTC as the best will remove from market creating permanent capital never to be moved again.

The club calls are chosen for a reason and have contained a lot of Alpha . 

Eg TMC , Atome , both doubled shortly after they presented 

Smiths Industries today is selling its very successful security Divison which has been a wildly successful theme for the club ( Osis & Evlv ) and John Deere is entering a super cycle where we will be looking at the roll out of autonomous tractors not cars ! A far easier user case to understand and one that retail can easily understand and latch on to. 

We know you are busy and record these meetings for that reason , but We don’t pick companies randomly because we have to (like a broker) , we pick them because there is a reason we are very interested. 

Please join us if you can , Katie will post the links later , 

Very best

[25/06/2025, 09:58:15] ~ William Nutting: 5 things: 

1st a Shout out to CONOR; great flag on Dopamine Hit Video Games play: TTWO US, fabulous technicals. CEO Zelnick is a genius. GTA V1 will be monster! “Life is like a Video game”. 

HELIUM/HNT:  now fascinates and mea culpa is a bit of a “Pierre!” -63% YTD.  What matters is the business is going gang-busters. On catalysts: an August halving, LatAm expansion, and MHNO alignment, a rerating may be in play.
Nutstuff has written a “How Trump would pitch Helium” and “think about Helium as Siamese twins” and delivering it on stage at the “Weird Shit Investing Conference” in NYC tomorrow! 
***Anyone who wants the pitch can send it after!

Digital Assets: 
MSTR US 91% chance gets S&P500 entry.
NEW MASTERCARD CRYPTO PARTNERSHIP ALLOWS 3 BILLION CARD HOLDERS TO BUY BITCOIN ON CHAIN. (Buying Bitcoin onchain is about to be as normal as swiping for coffee.) 

URANIUM:  LTBR US: nice +14% yday. A few asking.  I see CEO is presenting at Nuclear Conference in Zurich this week and prob seeing investors too. $30m of inflows to come from R2000/3000 entry coming. Short volume was 53% yesterday.  ( another Russell add is ASPI US) 

The HUT. / THG US. Another “marmite” CEO but Nutstuff stayed patient here. Nutrition MyProtein is the driver, and profitable. Everyone asleep on this. Suspect now the lemmings start pushing…

16% up today on the news about ' return to growth' but even if just the average analyst target of 57p, before today, that is another 70% higher. Short interest presume is quite high too.

They too are having their own autonomous and robotic supercyle .

Tomorrow, we’re joined live by Jahmy Hindman (CTO) and Josh Jepson (CFO) of Deere & Co – a $137bn giant leading the charge in agricultural autonomy.

From driverless tractors that run 24/7 to AI-powered precision farming, Deere is building the future of food and autonomy at once.

[25/06/2025, 21:28:57] ~ Luke Dyas: Stock is trading at same level as IPO day in April 2021 when it was pretty much a spot crypto trading exchange with expectations to be an institutional custodian. There were pretty much no expectations to be a crypto infrastructure play (Coinbase Payments), have reserve income from USDC via Circle, be a perpetual futures trading platform with a tokenized equities offering on the horizon (high chance this is approved in next two years). So yes its misunderstood.

[26/06/2025, 11:52:13] Nick finegold: It’s going to be another goodie . Yesterday smiths group is not only buying back shares and restructuring it has Elliot advisors on the share register and they are likely to have another £1bn + back ti shareholders on top of the buyback . Sometimes these companies have a ton of value .
[26/06/2025, 11:53:34] ~ Matt H: Goldman on copper: The ongoing US Section 232 copper investigation continues to drive an unusually wide gap between COMEX (US) and LME (UK) prices, resulting in the US over-importing ~400kt of copper so far this year. US inventory has risen to over 100 days worth of consumption, up from just 33 days at the beginning of the year.
As a result, the ex-US copper market has tightened, causing fears of a regional copper shortage despite the global market currently being in surplus. The front of the LME curve has tightened substantially, with the LME Cash contract briefly trading over $10,000/t on June 23rd, and has traded at a $95-379/t premium to the 3 Month contract this week.
We upgrade our 2H 2025 LME copper price forecast to an average of $9,890, up from $9,140 previously. We expect the copper price to rise to a peak for the year of $10,050 in August due to (1) the tariff-driven reduction in ex-US stocks, and (2) China sentiment and activity remaining relatively resilient (for now), before declining to $9,700 by December. The expected decline reflects our base case (80% probability) of a 25% tariff being put in place on US copper imports by September, but a later-than-expected tariff implementation could keep LME prices higher for longer.
We reiterate our copper tariff trade of long Dec-25 COMEX-LME copper arbitrage as we believe that the current market implied tariff of 14% is significantly under-pricing the potential for a 25% or 50% tariff.
[26/06/2025, 12:17:11] ~ Luke Dyas: Struggling with the linear thinking in the UBS Tesla report. They assume the robotaxi will work (or the forecast would be zero), but still only project 2.3mn on the road by by 2040, despite the model Y being the bestselling car globally for the last two years selling over 1mn a year, so are implying a major production collapse. Ark’s BEAR case is 7mn by 2030. UBS assumes $105k to $147k revenue per robotaxi! Their $3 per mile is too high but they only model 8 hours a day and robots don’t sleep so 16hours more likely. Owners get >70% of revenue according to Elon (so assume 70% of $100k). So what UBS misses is this provides a fully managed hypothetical annual yield of 200% on a $35k robotaxi! Even at a 20% yield, a robotaxi would fully pay for itself and buyers would flood in, availability would soar, per mile pricing would drop and new use cases would emerge. Begs the question why would you buy any other car? No other manufacturer plans to run this model so this should give Tesla total market dominance (in addition to already producing the entire Waymo fleet every 5 hours!).

1. TUNGSTEN UK/ TUN LN +58% in 5 days and now +>100% From Portfolio entry and still a deminimous Mkt Cap if a real co. With real assets. Remains a Nutstuff UK “Rare Earths/ defence materials” play. I take comfort from the quality of fellow shareholders of Stuart Mitchell and Pete Davies. 

2. INMB US: see trading @$12= $250m+ Mkt Cap +95% a/ hrs.  
The Key Alzheimers Data is now confirmed as being due monday. ( see link below) The shorts are truly nervous. 
As per last weeks update on Nutstuff: 
Remains a “special sit” that fascinates: 
“On Treatment for Alzheimer’s it’s the most asymmetric opportunity I think I have ever seen.”
It’s a $100b+ revenue opportunity and could be over $1T of equity value. The Market is pricing in less than 1% chance of it hitting. I think the odds are much better. 
The opportunity remains as laid out: This is now a $250m Mkt Cap. co that could be doing $100b in revs (4m patients at $25k each) and $70b in EBIT in 2027. What’s this call option worth? Even if it’s only a 1% shot..? Does anyone remember SAVA with bad science @$5b.?!

[27/06/2025, 11:06:48] ~ William Nutting: Tx on AVIO & Eutelsat. 

3 Friday things:

INMB: Nutstuffs totally binary outcome alzheimers play is +77% a/hrs and the data is imminent. Honestly wtf knows but if its good this will make Bitcoin treasury returns look positively dull. Any of you options gurus, tell me how often you see a gamma squeeze like this!  

GOLD: something tells me it might be in for a proper leg down. The fact that it didnt make new highs amidst peak “Iran fears” to me is a key negative. I have technicals worth considering.  Anyone similar thoughts ?!

CANNABIS: GLASF/US.  Conviction abounds here. The Cannabis trade has been a wild one. I said 18+ mths ago we probably need the MSOS ETF to shut down and seems we are pretty close to that now! Whether it happens or not is a mute point as the ETF has been destroyed and even on the good news outlined below it seems retail has largely capitulated and given up hope on formalisation in the sector after so many false promises and fits and starts. Thats Fine from where I sit, as if things move forward, the move will be that much more extreme. If they don't, Glass House / GLASF US will keep moving ahead, with ~40% greenhouse cap utilisation.  SAFE banking and rescheduling are 2 huge catalysts, but not necessary for companies like Glass House to thrive, though they would provide the rocket fuel.  As good news often comes like buses, the past few weeks has been insane with several hundred hectare illicit grows in California being shut down and the past 36 hours being just remarkable. It will be interesting to watch things progress as we are well positioned already.

[27/06/2025, 12:19:01] ~ KC Shetty: @⁨~William Nutting⁩ nice one on Gold. Neither this nor the other ' currencies' such as BTC or Silver have been behaving as it should. DXY is approaching strong support and a shake up in ' consensus ' positioning is a good possibility.

[27/06/2025, 12:38:00] ~ Dipesh Patel: If it takes support where do you think it can get to?
[27/06/2025, 12:47:18] ~ KC Shetty: Will have to see how it evolves as a big level broke down at 101.5. If the retracement forms appropriate patterns in coming weeks, cannot rule out similar to 2017, when too a big level broke down and then it crawled back up towards 105. That would imply move towards 112. For now , potential challenge to the 100 levels only.

My view at this moment is only to be very cautious of large   longs in  Gold/ silver/ BTC and shorts in Dollar.

[29/06/2025, 18:41:38] ~ Luke Dyas: I bought this week after listening to All-In  (24mins in). Veo 3 content creation + captive distribution on Youtube is an unrivalled combo. + they have a several new businesses  that could each be trillion dollar opportunities (TPUs taking on Nvidia + DeepMind probably the most exciting) https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/all-in-with-chamath-jason-sacks-friedberg/id1502871393?i=1000713909406
[29/06/2025, 18:49:02] ~ Luke Dyas: Think it has to be a long term position though as tough to know when chat gpt impact on core search business is fully priced in. Likely getting there but could still be a rocky couple of quarters ahead.
[30/06/2025, 05:47:15] Nick finegold: I think the key to puzzle on search Luke is contained in podcast you sent. 

1/ Absolutely, no doubt Alphabet is loosing market share in search measured as a % of the total number of queries. 

2/ However , total number of queries would have expanded greatly. I personally don’t use chat GPT and Gemini the same way I use Google search. 

3/ The new ai can be used to optimise results for advertisers. No one has more data about consumers than Google , so one could assume it is this that is there moat , not an indefensible 90% market share. 

So the only way to measure the impact accurately is really advertising $ and digital continues to grow. 

Meantime YouTube , as revenues should grow aggressively, Google cloud clearly has some sort of TPU attractions and Waymo is not about the cost of cars it’s about safety and cost  where it also seems to have an edge. 

Will be interesting to watch Alphabet this week . I bought some last week in alpha capture for full disclosure .
[30/06/2025, 05:55:12] ~ Andrew Draycott: The innovator’s dilemma. Interestingly the ft ran an article on the sotp, and it trades on 12x pe ex R&D, half that of the S&P. That’s pretty attractive given ROIC of 27%; you’d have to back a business they had evolved at every turn, android, cloud, you tube, waymo, deep seek.
[30/06/2025, 06:10:44] Nick finegold: And biotech having mapped every protein in the world . The All in podcast explains they have numerous multi trillion opportunities outside of ai and core search and the distribution to catalyse those opportunities.

[30/06/2025, 07:06:21] ~ Richard Windsor: Agree its cheap but this measure "trades on 12x pe ex R&D" doesent make sense. Without R&D there is no product and therefore no business. Consequently, it must be included. Its the reason gross margins are good. I would stick with GAAP as its the one thing that allows a true comparison. Even on GAAP its cheap.
[30/06/2025, 07:23:35] ~ Andrew Draycott: Depends if there is a delayed gestation on past r&d, for example have they monetised ai capex already? I get your point, but I doubt anyone saw cloud generation at these levels two years ago.

I want to zoom in on the real-life experiences and live events angle. Thinking: Ticketmaster/CTS Eventim, Disney, Booking, restaurants, travel, hotels, Man United…

If you want real world then MSGE and IMAX same theme but less debt. Live Nation and Eventbrite give you some digital scaling on top of these venue based models.

Its a bit of a defence play on collaboration with Anduril, but I bought as like the flying taxis theme ahead of the 2028 LA olympics where Archer will ferry people around in the skys, which I think will be a major watershed event leading to more mainstream adoption. Archer will deliver and start operating their first aircraft this summer in the UAE.

[01/07/2025, 06:53:47] Nick finegold: Another bull signal for Coinbase ?

“Ark Invest sells $43.8 million worth of Coinbase shares as stock trades near all-time high”

A couple of things to point out here Kathy “would if she could, but she can’t . “

1/ Most retail investors had owned Coinbase for a
Potential rally in crypto , NOT the Genius Act that legitimised stable coins . 

It is this legislation of Stable Coins that caused the recent rally in Coinbase shares and not BTC going exponential post the halving as many had hoped for which leaves room for another leg should this occur. 

2/ The Trump administrations  new federal framework for Crypto is due to report in July . This was always seen as the catalyst for BTC and other tokens. 

3/ This will no doubt encourage corporate / pension fund buying of crypto through some form of incentive so that Trump and his family can further enrich himself.

4/ Remonetisation of the current system is something that Will , Raoul and Connor all talk about endlessly in order to re set the debt spiral. Lower rates seem inevitable although , what this leads to is uncertain . 

Coinbase is at the epicentre of these efforts although new competion will undoubtedly emerge. ‎<This message was edited>

no one really gets the depth of coinbase infrastructure yet. Interestingly they fumbled the BTC treasury element though even with all the info they still missed it.
[01/07/2025, 07:16:41] Nick finegold: Agreed,  but they do own a lot of BTC on their balance sheet and their lane has been to play the game as safely as possible within what regulations existed . To be foundational and picks and shovels in the gold rush . Thats what got them where they are and culturally has served them well.

[01/07/2025, 07:53:12] ~ Jonny Haycock: Meanwhile, pls treat this with the large dose of salt it deserves but I have heard from a couple of quarters now Warren Buffett, with his record cash pile has been looking at a Club name, Newmont Mining as offering deep value. I obviously have no edge and wasn’t sure whether to even mention it but clearly, as a ndd aaane a few if you seem to follow, if Buffett were to buy in to precious metals shares, the sector would rerate immediately.

There was one listed gold mine Homestake.  I have always understood this to be explain a fair amount of Buffet’s unenthusiasm about gold.  He has owned either ABX or NEM before I recollect ……

[01/07/2025, 21:59:16] ~ Matt H: I also know that gold and bonds diversify each other, so I think about how much of each I should have for good risk control, and I know that a gold holding of roughly 15% can be an effective diversifier over time in that it produces a better return/risk ratio for the portfolio. Inflation-linked bonds do the same, so it is worth considering adding both to a typical portfolio.

Smacks of positioning/bets placed thinking of momo seasonality patterns; a possible USD positive divergence pattern and just some profit taking as the momo index hit (yet again) a level in the past you would sell at – but this is no July of the past and the USD is unlikely to do anything but continue its downwards journey; and I look at such s/t moves? As a buying opportunity accordingly…_

A few thoughts if I may..

Yes, there’s a clear capital-raising arms race underway. Dozens of blockchain firms are chasing the same speculative capital, bidding up their own valuations in a race to secure short-term inflows. As dilution accelerates, many of these vehicles are bound to collapse—especially those burdened by short-horizon debt or relying on sustained premiums over NAV. When bitcoins-per-share growth stalls, the illusion cracks, and so too will many of these structures. Meme coin culture shifting to Bitcoin may fade. 
But that’s only half the story.
A parallel track is actually emerging—one built on conviction, not hype. Those who’ve done the work (10,000hrs - Gladwell) to truly understand Bitcoin don’t just see a volatile asset; they see pristine digital capital—a new kind of monetary foundation. ( no eye rolling!) 
The most strategically positioned treasuries—geographically diversified, debt-light, and long-term aligned—are quietly making a play to become internet-native central banks for their respective regions. Even a 1% chance of that reality is worth a premium. And it’s no longer just theory. Political winds are shifting (Trump’s open embrace of Bitcoin being the latest signal), and the capital base for Bitcoin-denominated balance sheets is getting deeper, more strategic, and more sovereign.
Crucially, this isn't just about belief in Austrian economics anymore. What’s coming is conviction through utility. The abstract monetary thesis is becoming real, visible, and accessible: remittances that settle instantly, capital markets that clear in real time, sovereign-grade custody, and digitally native financial services that bypass traditional rails. These aren’t speculative dreams—they’re tangible services people will use. The utility layer is what will separate short-term Ponzi dynamics from long-term monetary innovation.
Speculation will break. Conviction—and utility—will build.

As was explaining to someone why my convictionon ROBINHOOD as have had for sometime: the CEO gets it..
George and me were discussing the “Jack & Jill” of his message and it is..
  
Jack: “so when he talks tokenisation, why would I care about a tokenised Apple or Tesla? Isn’t it just a copy of the real stock, and no one’s really trading it yet?”

Jill: “Yes, liquidity might be low in the beginning — just like crypto was at the start. But here’s the point: for the first time, you can own U.S. stocks directly, globally, 24/7, without needing a bank or brokerage. It’s not a claim on your app — it’s a token you can actually custody yourself.”

Jack: “Wait… like in my digital / crypto wallet?”

Jill: “Exactly. You can literally store Tesla, Apple, or even SpaceX in your head — in your seed phrase. No counterparty, no opening hours, no middleman. It’s not just about trading — it’s about ownership architecture.”

Jack: “So I can hold SpaceX and Tesla in cold storage like I do Bitcoin?”

Jill: “Yup. As the rails mature — and staking, borrowing, and composability come online — this becomes real programmable finance, not just equities with a facelift.”

Jack: “Feels like the start of stocks becoming internet-native.”
[02/07/2025, 11:53:46] ~ Luke Dyas: Totally agree the reflexive premium loop will collapse as copycats dilute the narrative (think we've flagged that on this group). Personally I'm purely focussed on names trading at substantial NAV discounts so it becomes a cheap way of owning BTC assuming core businesses are not destroying significant value which can be the case (in a similar way as to why buying Japanese companies trading at a discount to cash is not always a good idea!). In the UK the FCA has a lot to answer for creating the UK BTC treasury bubble by prohibiting BTC ETFs, but this will be remedied later this year. Michael Saylor does seem to have an enduring cult following (similar to Elon) which I don't believe any of the smaller names can replicate.
[02/07/2025, 11:58:37] ~ Will Meadon: Thanks Luke , do you have a list of players trading on biggest discounts and indeed premiums pls?

 Bitcoin Group SE (ADE GR)is the best I've found. 40% discount to BTC + ETH holdings. Profitable core business. Regulated bank subsidiary that will benefit from MICA crypto rules. Just hopeless investor relations!

[03/07/2025, 10:06:32] ~ William Nutting: 3 Things: 
Tungsten/ TUN LN. more funding.
ATOM LN as above. 

IN TATTOO-LANDMAN LAND: OFFSHORE: ( some +ve laterals from a deal)
See Turkish Petroleum has just acquired Eldorado Drilling’s two warm stacked 7th gen drillships at an all-in price of USD 325-350m per rig. The deal makes sense for both parties in my view and is positive for the global deepwater market by taking out two key assets from available supply. The all-in cost is also above current equity market valuations, suggesting ~60-75% upside to most heavily discounted VAL and SDRL. While older, it also suggests Saipem’s option for DVD’s highly efficient drillship (85-90% upside to current share price) is in the money.
For the overall deepwater market, I see this as “hidden demand” not showing up in tendering lists, with two rigs corresponding to ~2-3% of global demand. Importantly, it also takes out two warm drillships owned by a smaller, tightly financed player, without the possibility to execute the same price discipline as the larger companies. Following the transaction, there are six stacked high spec. drillships (marketed for work), including 5 owned by the larger drillers (VAL, SDRL) and one owned by a shipyard.
All-In price above equity market valuations
Assuming an all-in price USD 338m, this implies a premium of ~75% in VAL, ~60% in SDRL and ~24% in NE, while RIG is priced ~3% above the transaction price on my calculations.

[03/07/2025, 16:20:53] Nick finegold: July 22nd is the deadline . 

Ok everyone I am going to completely embarrass myself as usual and make a bold prediction . 

BTC will pass $150,000 within the next 4 weeks . 

Here’s why ! 

The Trump administration’s Executive Order on January 23, 2025, created the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, directing it to develop and submit a recommended federal framework for digital asset regulation within 180 days. That timeline puts the expected delivery around July 22, 2025  ￼.

If he doesn’t create some long term tax incentives to get pension funds and treasury departments of corporates to buy BTC I will change my name to Salman Rushdie .

The END 

Favourite way to play it safe 

Coinshares & Coinbase 

If you want to buy Rocket fuel go for the miners like Marathon or Riot Platforms. 

I will personally bring playing safe . Good luck and please don’t remind me when I am wrong . X

‎[03/07/2025, 21:22:33] ~ Jonny Haycock: ‎image omitted
[03/07/2025, 21:48:43] ~ Luke Dyas: One big drawback of Bitcoin treasury stocks that no one seems to mention (including the above critique) is corporate tax if gains are ever realised. BTC treasury rankings ignore this, but it can heavily distort NAV valuations. The lower the BTC acquisition price, the bigger the unrealised gain and potential tax hit. In Germany, I've discovered Bitcoin Group SE may have to pay ~29.8% tax on BTC gains if sold. Given their very low BTC acquisition price, c.55% of the NAV discount might be explained by potential tax. Even factoring  this in there’s still a 15–20% discount vs BTC/ETH holdings, and the core biz has value — so it’s still interesting, just not as cheap as it looks. BTC treasury stocks are therefore perhaps a much less efficient way for retail to hold BTC vs ETFs. So I'm shifting more into COIN, just hope TFG hasn't pushed the price up first!

[06/07/2025, 14:27:44] ~ Luke Dyas: If you're still holding Tesla after the Eleon mayhem of 1H25, chances are you believe in the robotaxi thesis, which will continue to track just fine as Tesla has than 30x the self-driving data of Waymo. Waymo had far worse teething problems and had to recall the whole fleet, its just Elon is in the spotlight. The bears are throwing everything they can at it, but none of it seems to be sticking. So I'm just not sure who the incremental seller of Tesla is at this point so believe risk is skewed to the upside assuming no robotaxi fatalities. I'm fully convinced Robotaxis could quickly become the best yielding mainstream asset of all time with zero management required. Elon may even offer guaranteed yield in the early days to ensure availability for passengers. Lost EV subsidies are a rounding error in robotaxi economics so I'll be loading up the cybertruck if there is further weakness driven by qtly sales.

Digital Assets: 
1. IMHO the next couple of weeks will see a big arb trade between stocks and blockchain tokens of same stocks where there is low liquidity. It could get interesting buying teslas cheap on-chain etc.
Also see this: 🇦🇪 Toncoin partners with UAE to offer 10-year golden visa to $TON stakers.
Staking now gets you into a country.

2. Bitcoin will create an entirely new class of digital aristocrats. It isn’t based in Silicon Valley. It doesn’t wear Patagonia vests or answer to LPs. It doesn’t beg for capital. It earns. It waits. It simply holds.
If you view Bitcoin as a “traditional” investment, you likely wont mean it. 
It’s an IQ test wrapped in a Ponzi accusation, disguised as a protest, fueled by memes, hated by economists, worshipped by autists, backed by math, powered by entropy, and holding a mirror to the spiritual decay of fiat civilization.
You simply don’t “buy” Bitcoin as an investment. You wake up, and realise that everything else is actually just a lesser functioning out of date lie. ( tx AdamL)

[08/07/2025, 19:10:58] ~ Katie Jackson: Goldman on copper: The ongoing US Section 232 copper investigation continues to drive an unusually wide gap between COMEX (US) and LME (UK) prices, resulting in the US over-importing ~400kt of copper so far this year. US inventory has risen to over 100 days worth of consumption, up from just 33 days at the beginning of the year.
As a result, the ex-US copper market has tightened, causing fears of a regional copper shortage despite the global market currently being in surplus. The front of the LME curve has tightened substantially, with the LME Cash contract briefly trading over $10,000/t on June 23rd, and has traded at a $95-379/t premium to the 3 Month contract this week.
We upgrade our 2H 2025 LME copper price forecast to an average of $9,890, up from $9,140 previously. We expect the copper price to rise to a peak for the year of $10,050 in August due to (1) the tariff-driven reduction in ex-US stocks, and (2) China sentiment and activity remaining relatively resilient (for now), before declining to $9,700 by December. The expected decline reflects our base case (80% probability) of a 25% tariff being put in place on US copper imports by September, but a later-than-expected tariff implementation could keep LME prices higher for longer.
We reiterate our copper tariff trade of long Dec-25 COMEX-LME copper arbitrage as we believe that the current market implied tariff of 14% is significantly under-pricing the potential for a 25% or 50% tariff.

(creative, production, media buying & data/analytics) by tools that do a good enough or even better job at a fraction of the cost such as Runway, Midjourney, Celtra, Whalar, Jellysmack, Shuttlerock, The Trade Desk, Triple Whale and Mutiny. The problem is these tools are just not in the vernacular for public market investors in general, and the speed of change at which this is happening is creating major cognitive dissonance. Media was always the most vulnerable but we're going to see this theme play out across many sectors.

[09/07/2025, 16:26:35] ~ Matt H: Trump's announced 50% tariff on copper imports sent shock waves through the copper market, with the COMEX price spiking to a new high of $5.90/lb before settling at +11% on the day to $5.58/lb at 7pm EST. The COMEX-LME spread closed at 25%. Presumably this new tariff is a result of the Dept of Commerce investigation, as Secretary Lutnick indicated, but further clarity and details may be needed before the market fully believes. Freeport benefits most.

The US does not have nearly enough mine/smelter/refinery capacity to be self-sufficient in copper. As a result, import tariffs are likely to lead to continued significant price premiums in the US relative to other regions. All else equal, Freeport, Asarco (Grupo Mexico) and Rio Tinto are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of these new tariffs.

We estimate that - all else held equal - a 50% copper tariff in the US should lead to approximately $2.8bn of incremental annual FCF for Freeport.

In this report, we discuss the potential short-term and longer-term consequences of US copper tariffs, and we provide a detailed analysis of the US copper industry.

Tariffs in Play: The US Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated an investigation into copper imports as a potential national security concern in February and had until mid-November (270 days) to complete this investigation. We had expected the DOC to conclude that copper imports do qualify as a national security concern. We had also believed this could be the trigger for President Trump to roll out 25% tariffs on copper imports under Section 232. Trump's announced 50% tariffs on copper imports came as a surprise in terms of timing and magnitude, but tariffs were likely coming at some point. Higher copper prices in the US should ultimately incentivize growth investment in mines and new smelters/refineries. We believe the longer term aim of the Trump administration may be for the US to be fully self-sufficient in copper, but mines take too long to develop for this to be achieved in less than a 10-year time horizon, in our view. Getting there faster from a smelting/refining perspective is possible and would erode a competitive advantage that China currently has in the copper supply chain. However, as we discuss in this note, the US will still rely on foreign mines to meet demand for the foreseeable future. It is therefore possible that tariffs on refined copper imports will persist for a relatively long duration, which is what we have seen in the US steel industry following the roll-out of section 232 tariffs for steel by President Trump in 2018.

The Proverbial Air Pocket: While the COMEX copper price spiked today, the concern that some have now is that US buyers who have accumulated excess copper inventory will step out of the market as a result of the spike in prices (relevant charts and analysis are in this report). This could lead to temporary downward pressure on COMEX (and LME) prices, but the COMEX-LME spread should still widen. We assume that today's relatively muted response in share prices of copper miners that would benefit most from these tariffs (FCX closing up just 2.5%, for instance) is a reflection of 'buy the rumor, sell the news'. While a short-term air pocket with lower prices is possible, we would buy our preferred copper mining equities on any near-term weakness (FCX, TECK, LUN, FM, GLEN, AAL).

The Freeport Edge: Freeport accounts for about 60% of US mined copper production and also has a smelter in the US. We estimate that - all else held equal - a 50% copper tariff in the US should lead to approximately $2.8bn of incremental annual FCF for Freeport (note that we currently model a US price premium of 11% for four years, and we have not adjusted our model for today's announced 50% tariff). This is material relative to Freeport's current market cap of ~$66bn. The appropriate multiple to put on this incremental cash flow of course depends on the duration of the cash flow as well as the risk that the tariff rate is lowered. We believe an accelerated share buyback under the company's existing $3bn authorization would be a positive for Freeport's equity valuation.

[10/07/2025, 07:52:44] ~ William Nutting: To Davids point…

Visa and Mastercard’s role in a blockchain-integrated financial system is not just payment rails — it’s recourse infrastructure. Their primary utility becomes the clawback mechanism in the event of fraud, charge disputes, or systemic failures — something that on-chain systems, by design, struggle to handle due to their immutable nature.

In this way, they’re evolving into the consumer protection layer or the "bug buffer" on top of smart contract systems — a critical trust bridge between traditional finance users and on-chain applications. As Web3 frontends mature, these card networks are positioned to become the UX abstraction layer that gives users familiar tools with embedded protections — even as the backend moves entirely on-chain.

Basically the are becoming on sliver of the stack not THE STACK.

[10/07/2025, 09:39:59] Calum Curation: Interesting how perhaps its main market listing /planned move to Nasdaq has worked against it vs peers because it’s been harder for them to move as fast as peers initially in raising funds to buy bitcoin. 

Although if institutions start to play in the space then perhaps the main market listing will work in its favour.

[10/07/2025, 10:48:00] ~ Luke Dyas: If you take out the recent spike, the share price is not actually that depressed. It is hard to see institutional demand with a £14mn free float, especially if thats split across dual listings dampening liquidity further. They are not even in the top 50 BTC treasury holders, so they risk becoming an orphan stock in the US. Their core mining business lacks scale or ASIC pricing leverage, and even the big boys like Riot and Marathon are struggling. With BTC mining as a core business its likely ALL their BTC gains will be taxed as income, so far less tax efficient than BTC ETFs which the FCA is expected to approve soon for UK investors. Issuing dilutive equity as they have done today @ 13p is the opposite of the MicroStrategy playbook. As Raoul always says - you just don't need to go that far down the risk curve in bitcoin. Its an 80% vol asset!

[11/07/2025, 06:47:49] Nick finegold: Worth watching the video on Rainbow rare earths after all the shenanigans yesterday and talk on the chat . 

Only a small cap for now,  who for full disclosure signed up with Curation Connect. 

However, if you want to understand how credible this rare earth story is look no further than the first minute of their video where you will see that the US Government gave them $50m last year to extract rare earths which suggests they are small but highly credible . 

We met the management only two days ago and it’s going to be a very low cost producer in a couple of years . Worth some time .

[11/07/2025, 07:01:25] ~ William Nutting: DIGITAL ASSET Lift-off. 🚀 ( watch BTC/Ethe too) 
Bitcoin just hit $116,000 for the first time. 
10 years ago it was trading at $290. That's a 400x increase (+82% annualized). It is now up +55% since its April 2025 lows.
Meanwhile, the $ US Dollar just had its WORST start to a year since 1973, -11% in 6 months. This is not a coincidence.
I think it IS now relevant to say: “Just imagine owning zero BTC right now.”
900m Digital wallets ( question is how many are active!) but start to think about Bitcoin as a globally adopted monetary asset. Think
21million vs a world population of 8 billion, that’s just 262,500 satoshis per person (1 bitcoin = 100 million satoshis). 
I still maintain that very few realise the insane demand for block space that is now coming from TradFi. The Stablecoin TAM is in the many $ trillions and volumes a massive multiple of that and that's just the start.  
This doesn't include the Web3 demand from web2 conversion that will follow over time. Nutstuff still sees a path of 6 to 8 years to $100trn as an asset class for crypto....

Nutstuff “owns”: 
BITCOIN, ETHE, DOGE, HNT US. 
Bitcoin Treasury/ “NEWFI”: MSTR US (owns 600,000 bitcoin and is going to be the most hated rally ever.) ALTBG FP / H100/ BTC LN/ 
Ethereum treasury: SBET US. ‎<This message was edited>

A Friday thought: If blockchain brings one big thing into the world, it’s governance.
Not money. Not tokens. Governance.
Different models, tailored to different human needs — scalable, transparent, and participatory.
Over the next decade, we’ll see mass participation and the unbundling of institutional inefficiency. ( similar to what CURATION are doing to Rsch & ideas etc)
[11/07/2025, 08:52:30] ~ William Nutting: Something I remain focussed on ..

HELIUM/ HNT is a token. $400m is a ludicrous valuation. HELIUM IS STRUCTURED AS SIAMESE TWINS WHERE BOTH ARE CO-DEPENDENT FOR VITAL ORGAN SHARING ( NETWORK) BUT ONE RIGHT NOW IS DRINKING 85% OF THE MILK! NO MOBILE REVS! ACCRUES TO NOVA LABS WHO ARE THE LARGEST BUYER OF THE HNT TOKEN. THATS MAD & TOTALLY UNSUSTAINABLE AND IMHO THAT GETS FIXED.

🔥 Markets at a near-term peak – July 17th marks seasonal topping; chop likely after. In portfolio, we’ve reduced low conviction positions and doubling down on *Newmont (Gold)* within our Thematic Ten.
💥 Earnings kick off – Banks well-positioned; market is ‘on the fence’. With the Thematic Ten and Collective 30 only *MilDef* reporting this week after Friday’s profit warning. Mgmt. call being set up for mid August.
📉 Macro focus – CPI/PPI due; Trueflation says inflation is falling, but no one’s watching.
🇺🇸 Trump’s tariffs – 30% on EU, 25% on Japan/SK. Market still in denial – he won’t back down.
🏦 FED fireworks – Powell’s position looks increasingly untenable. Resignation or removal coming?
🇬🇧 UK politics – General Election in 2026? Budget in Oct could trigger. Reform would look set for a landslide victory.
🪙 Crypto in focus – Bitcoin = the ultimate asset. Airlines now accepting crypto. We are also doubling down on *Coinbase* in with the Thematic Ten. 
📈 Yields – JGBs, USTs, Gilts all near inflection; long-end blowout risk rising.
🇨🇳 China – Domestic consumption shows early signs of life.

🔮 1998 vibes returning… Watch for Fed shifts, tariffs becoming reality, and crypto surging.

[14/07/2025, 08:05:50] ~ Robin Maxwell: I don’t think anyone sitting in SE England or working in London will have the right ‘feel’ for how bad it’s getting out there … if we get a winter of discontent then 2026 election odds will shorten rapidly. Need to monitor local press going forward from Cardiff to Newcastle and everywhere in between.
[14/07/2025, 08:16:36] ~ Tom Wiggin: I’m not sure that discontent leads to an election when the sitting government have a spectacular majority.   It may lead to people wandering into a betting shop and betting that there is going to be one but that (unfortunately) isn’t the same thing.    
Only if the government had a wafer thin majority would massive discontent lead to a fall in government (most likely triggered by a vote of no confidence etc).
[14/07/2025, 10:45:24] ~ Tim Sykes: Outwith the limitation of the fixed term the only person who can call a general election is the prime minister. And they tend to like the shiny Range Rover and cpo do don’t choose to go when they will lose.
[14/07/2025, 10:47:04] ~ Tim Sykes: More likely is the pm is ousted by his party. Which is possible. In which case the likely new Pm would be Angela Raynor or possibly Wes Streeting. There is mumbling about a leadership challenge for May next year.

[15/07/2025, 16:09:45] ~ William Nutting: Its becoming a nightmare now sitting in a number of restaurants and having to wade through a sea of delivery drivers.  Or sit at a table whilst they stand waiting with their helmets on..
As to deliveroo etc its fascinating who/ how most of these get recruited….
[15/07/2025, 16:11:22] ~ Luke Dyas: Meituan has been doing drone fast food delivery for a while in China, even to the Great Wall.  Meituan just expanded to Hong Kong and Dubai. Regulation has meant the US is way behind in the low altitude economy but that is starting to change.

[15/07/2025, 16:27:29] ~ Luke Dyas: I’ve been following zipline for a while (best US drone maker) but not listed unfortunately. Zipline vision is that their drones lower food/goods 300ft using a droid (to avoid noise pollution) straight into a hatch in the side of your apartment/house “direct to kitchen” (so your fridge basically restocks itself) potentially without you doing anything as a form of “ambient commerce” where no human action is taken.

Off-premises dining now accounts for 75% of all restaurant traffic, with Gen Z & millennials driving the shift. Here’s how to grab a slice 🍕 of the evolution:

🔹 Pure-plays:
	•	DoorDash (DASH) – 67% US share, +45% YTD 📈
	•	Uber (UBER) – Eats + rides + freight, +54% YTD
	•	Deliveroo (ROO) – UK stronghold, +25% YTD
	•	Zomato (ETERNAL) – India leader, +22% YTD

🔹 Chains:
	•	Domino’s (DPZ) – Digital delivery pioneer
	•	Starbucks (SBUX) – Mobile-led off-premises growth

🔹 Tech enablers:
	•	Toast (TOST) – POS + digital infra
	•	Instacart (CART) – Grocery delivery leader

🎯 Aggressive? DASH & UBER
🛡️ Defensive? DPZ & SBUX
🛠️ Infra play? TOST

📣 Any other names?
[15/07/2025, 17:31:37] ~ Luke Dyas: Olo is a better drone delivery play than Toast (Tost). Toast works mainly with SMB restaurants which lose in a drone delivery world which work much better with consolidated hub and spoke centralised delivery models (distance becomes less of an issue). Olo more enterprise focussed and already working with Sweetgreen/zipline.
[15/07/2025, 17:35:02] ~ Luke Dyas: Actually Sweetgreen with it’s zipline tie up is probably one of the most geared plays though it’s currently struggling with competition

Elon Musk’s xAI has signed an important new customer: the U.S. government. 

The two-year old AI company—most recently in the news when its chatbot praised Hitler—said in a blog post Monday that it has launched a new division, called “Grok with Government” and signed a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense. xAI also announced that it had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products will now be available for purchase across every government office and agency.

[16/07/2025, 06:14:30] Nick finegold: Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic were also awarded up to $200 million contracts as part of the new effort, according to the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. A number of tech companies, including Meta, Amazon, and Google, have either started working with or upped their work with the U.S. government in the last year as the taboo in Silicon Valley of working with the Defense Department has fallen away.

For those following the driverless cars/Tesla theme, this went a little unnoticed yesterday. Baidu was +10% at one point but hasn't followed through as strongly in Asia. I do own it as I think it's dirt cheap and has a bunch of stuff like Google that is very undervalued despite the threat to search revs.

[16/07/2025, 10:50:58] ~ Morgan: Any further thoughts / insight on this (BTC LN)? 

Real dog in contrast to the rally in actual Bitcoin….!
[16/07/2025, 10:57:22] Calum Curation: Coinsilium and Vaultz Capital have fallen sharply this week and aren’t far behind BTC LN. Although SWC also falling they were able to move harder and faster than the others and have a much bigger bitcoin treasury as a result which insulates them to some degree. Despite the fall they are still trading on multiples of their bitcoin holdings vs US bitcoin treasury companies on much smaller premia. Although main market may be an advantage in the future for BTC LN it seems to have hindered them in the short run as they weren’t able to move as quickly. From what I’ve read there is also a lot of distrust of David lenigas which may have hurt BTC.
[16/07/2025, 10:58:03] Calum Curation: There is clearly a lot of eye balls on the companies though so wouldn’t take much buying to create a fomo frenzy again! So wouldn’t be surprised to see them blast up again if Bitcoin goes to $150k in short run
[16/07/2025, 10:58:46] Calum Curation: Anyway there are lots of others on here who are far more informed on the subject than me so interested in other people’s views

[16/07/2025, 16:50:12] ~ David Haysey: She has indeed gone. Worth listening to FD (and acting CEO)’s comments which I think are on their website under the last results. From memory he said capex should normalise from c3bn to around a more normal 2.7 over the next two years which should lift FCF. There’s no top line growth to speak of although the worst of the stock cycle impact is behind them. In a market where growth is generally absent or -ve they are over indexing in most products and guiness going gangbusters unlike most beer brands. Stock is back to level of nine years ago and on a market multiple. Seems a bit cheap for business with GM of 60% and OM 27% (used to be 30) and great portfolio of brands. 
Béar case is whether era of big drink brands is permanently over and tariffs (I think 60% of US sales are from Mex and Can).

🩶 *Silver’s Bullish Setup =* Structural squeeze + macro tailwinds 

⛏️ *Supply shrinking*

Global silver output is falling – only 835m oz expected in 2025, down >7% vs 2014. Lower ore grades, depleted resources & 7–10 year project timelines = tight pipeline.

🪙 *Demand surging*

- 2024 industrial demand hit record 680.5m oz (4th straight year)
- Solar to drive 14% of global silver demand in 2025 (vs 5% in 2014)
- EVs use 50% more silver – 2025 sales = 600+ tonnes demand
- Electronics + 5G = strong secular pull

➕*Investment tailwinds*

- Inflation hedge (avg 4.2%)
- Safe-haven appeal in uncertain geopolitics
- Gold/silver ratio still ~90 i.e. silver deeply undervalued

🔑 About *58% of silver demand* in 2025 comes from industrial uses - notably much higher than gold. This demand is hitting record highs and is projected to rise further. ‎<This message was edited>

He’s currently leading at -3. He went through the qualifying events to get in showing good form (which was a good leading indicator for Justin Rose last year).
[17/07/2025, 10:53:30] ~ Katie Jackson: Thanks Jonny - does this mean that the short seller have taken up shares availble to lend or that brokers restricting how much they want to be leveraged? Or something else?
[17/07/2025, 12:09:01] ~ Jonny Haycock: For me it is simply further evidence of an increasingly tight mkt. This corroborates what we are seeing every day in the physical mkts too. Supply is getting squeezed and demand is increasing as dollar remains in crisis. There’s no reason to think silver won’t rip higher in coming months, in my view. The only way to satisfy the increasing demand will be in materially higher prices.
[17/07/2025, 12:11:26] ~ KC Shetty: Any comments on EZJ - easyJet , post their results today and down 5%, will be helpful.  🙏
[17/07/2025, 12:16:07] ~ Jason M: I agree on silver fwiw have bought platinum as well on similar logic
[17/07/2025, 12:20:37] Nick finegold: Yes, nos cut for FY by house broker on French Air traffic control and higher fuel, EZJ holidays going well and I think the company will raise guidance at FY. Shares down today but not thesis changing. Fleet upgrade , greater efficiency, holidays seeing good growth  and capacity due to improve slowly.  So a one off £25m hit to profits is what’s caused the disappointment . It’s a buy but may take a little time to move upwards .

[17/07/2025, 12:32:43] Nick finegold: Maybe for somewhat different reasons
[17/07/2025, 12:33:44] ~ Philip Donald: Over most time periods , Gold goes up the most and falls the least ?
[17/07/2025, 12:35:44] ~ Jason M: Think it’s all the same trade. Ie we don’t trust the dollar Bitcoin and precious metals all go up. Just fancy platinum and to lesser extent silver slightly more under the radar than gold and could play catch up. But they are all buys
[17/07/2025, 12:35:57] ~ Jonny Haycock: Yes. But history shows that in the big bull mkts (which this obviously is) silver eventually overtakes gold but with its customary higher volatility. So, as we have discussed Philip, I think the next leg will be driven by silver and the ratio could easily drop to 60 but with both going up a lot.
[17/07/2025, 12:37:03] ~ Jonny Haycock: That’s why we have advised our clients over the last few months when the ratio hit 100 to shift from 80/20 gold/silver to 70/30.
[17/07/2025, 12:37:37] ~ Philip Donald: To what extent are central banks buying any silver ? Is there a silver council that plans to issue ‘ digital silver ‘ ?
[17/07/2025, 12:39:14] ~ Jonny Haycock: It’s just not liquid enough Philip for any material central bank buying. They’ll stay, I expect buying gold.
[17/07/2025, 12:46:00] ~ Simon Brewer: On a different tack - I was re-reading the yield curve control history the US had in place 1945-51 post WW2.

We had Scaramucci for dinner with Money Maze Sponsors and Corporate Partners this week at my house, and he thinks the plan is to have Bessent be both Treasury Secretary and Chair of the Fed.  Remember the Fed was under Treasury control in that war/post war period ..… worth processing!

[17/07/2025, 13:57:19] Nick finegold: Economic data bottom line: the 8:30amET numbers were bullish in aggregate from a growth perspective (robust retail sales, higher Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing, lower claims, etc.) but will also likely push rates higher and bolster the Fed’s view that standing on the sidelines makes the most sense right now (which risks inflaming tensions between Trump and Powell). 
US retail sales were very strong in June, coming in at +0.6% M/M on the headline (vs. the Street +0.1%). The control group was also above plan at +0.5% M/M (vs. the Street +0.3%), although control revisions were neg. for May (now +0.2% vs. the prior +0.4%). Areas of strength in June included autos (+1.2%), building materials/garden supply (+0.9%), clothing (+0.9%), and miscellaneous store retailers (+1.8%). Areas of weakness included furniture/home furnishings (-0.1%), electronics/appliances (-0.1%), gas stations (flat), sporting goods/musical instruments (+0.2%), and department stores (-0.8%). 
The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for July was very strong at 15.9, up from -4 in June and above the consensus forecast of -1, as both demand and prices climbed. “The survey’s indicator for general activity returned to positive territory, and the indexes for new orders and shipments both increased this month. All three indexes recorded their highest readings since February. The employment index turned positive, suggesting overall increases in employment. Both price indexes rose after declining last month and continue to suggest overall price increases”.
Weekly jobless claims moved in an encouraging direction, with initials falling to 221K (down from 228K in the prior month) while continuing eased lower from the recent highs.
Import/export prices for June were mixed, with import prices coming in cooler than anticipated (+0.1% M/M vs. the Street +0.3%) while export prices jumped 0.5% (vs. the Street forecast of flat).

[17/07/2025, 15:51:08] ~ JB: S28 ASP needs to come down so it can go onto future smartphones 

Lots of uses for S28 in high end semis.  

LTBR are years away from commercial production. Last time I checked they are trying to enhance nuclear fuel rods not enrich silicon into s28.
[17/07/2025, 16:29:29] ~ SSCOOK: Think Nick is onto something with his read on EZJ today and on the longer term value proposition call in the name (as their fleet u/g kicks in) - below are a few key #’s to keep in mind: 

1) YTD -11% and cheap valuation (7x PE, 2x EV/EBITDA) gives EZJ no credit for either a) the bumper easyJet holiday year they are set to deliver = PBT + 35% growth in FY25 (to contribute 35% of group PBT, way ahead of 25% target) on track for EBITDA margin of 15% (500bps > Jet2) nor b) a decent year for underlying airline biz = +9% ASK growth and flat costs ex-fuel. They have been transparent that RASK is under pressure in 2025 (they have growth airline revs +7% despite this 9MTD) so this is not a negative surprise.

2) the fleet upgrade is the key thesis for the stock to 2028 has not really even begun to kick in. At the end of this year only 10% of new/better 99 planes will have been delivered. The delivery schedule is back end loaded in 2027 and 2028. 

3) Their balance sheet has improved to >£800m in net cash vs £181m at YE24. Balance sheet strength is key to fleet upgrade as they plan to fully own more vs leasing. 

4) punishing them for a £25m pretax hit to 2025 earnings as you mentioned should only cost their share price 20p at EZJ’s current valuation multiple. EZJ stock price was 525-530 level going into the July3/4th French strikes. 

5) shares have been dusted by both RYA and LHA year to date, both +20% so clearly not a sector issue at work here.

[18/07/2025, 08:04:03] Nick finegold: This is interesting, from Adam , the current talent war in the big caps just reinforced their dominance as start up can’t afford to hire . 

Talent War: As cars become AI-driven robots, how can legacy auto keep up with tech firm offers for multi-hundred-million-$ contracts for top talent?

Tech companies' move into the physical/manufacturing world is, in some ways, a validation of the tremendous potential value unlock in automating road transportation, defense and humanoid markets. At the same time, it's a potentially concerning sign for incumbent players to have to 'pay up' to attract new talent and keep their best talent on board.
The recent amping up of the AI/robotics talent war is a key reason why we expect Tesla to host an 'AI Day' in the not-too-distant future. The recruiting value alone is a key priority, in our view. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/07/2025, 08:05:36] Nick finegold: Also ……… 

The best argument I have heard to date for camera only driving. It’s not one I believe in particularly unless cameras can see in the dark or fog , but it’s the most rationale one I have heard .
[18/07/2025, 08:05:59] Nick finegold: No LiDAR: As Tesla continues to 'expand' its robotaxi geofence in the Austin area, including new plans to inaugurate new cities in other US States (Arizona, California, etc.), investors continue to see the company 'doubling down' on its rather novel approach to on-board autonomy - camera only.

"Annoyingly... Elon is right." These were the words of a vision expert at a rival autonomous vehicle startup when discussing the pros and cons of using sensor fusion (camera + Radar + LiDAR) vs. Tesla's camera only approach to autonomy for its robotaxi fleet.
The analogy of the two 'Baby Tarzans' is helpful. Imagine two ‘Baby Tarzans’ dropped into different parts of a vast jungle with one singular goal: survive a full year on your own. Baby Tarzan 1 was equipped with water, energy bars, night vision goggles, a laser gun, a fire-starting kit, a poncho, a tent, an assortment of knives and medical supplies. Baby Tarzan 2 was given nothing. BT1 will likely eat that first night and sleep comfortably by the fire. BT2 may go hungry that night… maybe for several nights. When a year had passed, both had survived. Who learned more?
We don't think investors fully appreciate the potential advantages of 'sensorial parsimony' as practiced by Tesla's current robotaxi fleet... purposely depriving the vehicles of LiDAR to force the vehicles to achieve a different pace of learning.
Through a hypothetical lens ask yourself what is better: (a) a robotaxi with a hardware/sensor approach that is slightly safer today but with a slower rate of improvement? Or (b) a robotaxi that may be slightly less safe today but with a much faster rate of improvement that could make it 10 to 100x safer in the next 5 to 10 years vs. the fusion approach?

On QUANTUM/ AI. Chapeau to the excellent Conor on his Quantum plays..
I thought this useful from todays Nutstuff..

“Maybe Quantum isn’t the end of the world. Maybe it’s us finally remembering where we came from”. 
(A lot of focus on the intersection of AI & Quantum so I thought worth some focus): 
AI is artificial. It ingests all the sensors and data in the world to form patterns and predictions. It reflects us our behavior, our biases, our inputs. It’s a feedback loop of digital mimicry. Powerful, but derivative. A mezzanine to quantum.  Quantum, by contrast, is organic.  It’s not trying to simulate intelligence. It is intelligence, natural, probabilistic, and in harmony with the deeper structures of reality. Humans, in our curiosity, have tried to build a machine not to dominate nature, but to reflect it. A machine that doesn’t impose order, but reveals the equilibrium that was always there. Like the story of the world made in six days: structured, ordered, sacred.    And here’s the key difference:  Nature although ‘brutal’ (see David Attenborough) doesn’t use passwords.  It doesn’t need to. Its systems are secured by symbiosis, not encryption. Quantum eats passwords for breakfast, not to threaten the world, but to restore balance. It is a return, not an attack. A return to a kind of logic where trust is inherent in the design of the universe, not something patched on afterward.  Of course, quantum is terrifying to a world so often out of balance, fractured, over-secured, and mistrustful.  But that’s just humans being humans.  And humans are nature, too.  Which means maybe, just maybe, quantum isn’t the end of the world. Maybe it’s us finally remembering where we came from.  Good luck to those trying to monetise true distributed quantum. It doesn’t bend to layers, systems, or schemes. It actually undoes them.
Quantum isn’t a feature of our world, it IS the world. And every artificial structure we’ve laid over nature — passwords, patents, pyramids of power, all dissolve in its presence.
Nature doesn’t need control. It runs on balance. Quantum eats control systems for breakfast and returns the world to equilibrium. The key question is: why would Microsoft release something that destroys their cash cow? They won’t, unless they can own or control the replacement. This is the paradox at the edge of real tech change: the most powerful technologies (like AGI or distributed quantum) threaten margins, control, and scarcity economics. The incumbents will only let them loose if they can wrap them in a product moat. Otherwise, they’ll suppress or slow-roll it. Put another way: “The dragon only gets released if they get to ride it.”

[21/07/2025, 14:49:20] ~ Robin Maxwell: Fielmann Group - Vision 2035 = EssilorLux 2.0. In my absence Fielmann released strong 1H/25 prelims with revs +12% and adj Ebitda +26% and group Ebitda margin at 23.7% (vs 21.1%) When I presented this idea to the club in Feb24 the SP was €32 and today trades at €56. Central to my argument and interest in the name is/was the idea that Fielmann is embarking on a new global strategy to become a global leader and that the town is big enough for both EL and Fielmann to operate at that global level. Last week they published their Vision 2035 “to evolve into a global provider of comprehensive vision and hearing care.” FIE trades on less than 2x ‘25 revs for a 20%+ ebitda margin and forward CAGR of near 10% (declared €4bn sales ambition by 2030). Yet EL trades on 4x revs and has sales 10x that of Fielmann… which suggests that the 2030 FIE sales target must be conservative relative to the 2035 global ambition. I see the company as a core mid cap holding still, in fact I think it’s looking reasonable value here again.

Even if you are 99% certain  crypto is a dangerous ponzi scheme ( as Dimon did ) you have to have  to have some small exposure just in case the 1% chance you are wrong materialises and it does go to $1m as the evangelists predict . If everyone does that it does go to $1m over time . 

As usual our industry has a habit of inventing a crypto language designed to cast intellectual superiority over its audience so they can charge fees for managing the asset. 

When all you really need to understand is that are going to be more buyers than sellers over time .

On Evolv & ONT LN : great job NF & team. 

A Couple of things where Nutstuff is focussed…

To all the doom mongers on markets, (not Conor, who does a stellar job! ) 
Yes trade deals ARE being done left right & centre.
SEE JAPAN. 
Yes Chinese / HK listed stocks are moving too whilst underowned and cheap. 

On BITCOIN/ digital assets, spare me the “ I cant own any, I am scarred by a bad bitcoin experience 5+ yrs ago; I parralel it with Carbon dioxide being the enemy”! Bitcoin is currently after its significant move a giant 0.2% of total global asset values?!! Carbon dioxide is 0.04% of the earths atmosphere. ( very different outcomes however if both go to 2%! 
( see screen shot here of largest digital asset moves in last 30days).  HNT & ETHEREUM. 

1. Both MESO US & CARDIOL / CRDL US are heart disease myocarditis/ pericarditis ♥️ Focussed. Positive data seems finally incoming and stocks really reacting in a somewhat dull “summery” Mkt.

2. URANIUM; still a clear bid, UEC ASPI LTBR ETC also see UROY & URC catching proper bids despite anaemic Uranium commodity price action and still surprisingly few deals..( ask what happens when finally shows up). 

3. ALPHABET Q2 EARNINGS TODAY... 
“GEMINI IS THE AI KING LONG TERM... “
On GOOGL, I am understanding the concept that  TPUs could actually be the disruptor of GPUs. I also can see NVDA being disrupted on the hardware side by China, but none of the actually wealthy TAM of consumer AI will use a Chinese AI, that has limited distribution. So Google dominance persists. 
Worth remembering that Alphabet/ Google has: 
4bn Android users - 
4bn Google Chrome users - 
3bn Google Workspace users - 
3bn YouTube users - 
2bn Gmail users - 
1bn Gmaps users - 
500m Gemini app users - 
10m+ Waymo rides so far - 
Pixel phone and watch hitting n.3 now after Apple and Samsung - 
Google XR glasses coming soon...  

Current Google has 12.5% of ALL US TV viewing time ( Nielsen) + Their consumer AI TAM is 1.5 billion with humans willing to pay $100 a month for AI tools, so ~$20trn... no one has the distribution Alphabet has... 
XAI may need to partner with Apple to match

[23/07/2025, 14:00:35] ~ Jason M: Hi. Question on Uranium.
Been in this space for 5/6 years now and big believer in nuclear. Although moved from uranium funds/miners to builders of the kit.
I find it interesting that most clever people seem to be long, give a v persuasive account of the inbalance in the market and that it is a matter of time before a spike occurs. 
Yet despite problems on supply side, people like Sprott buying up large quantities the price has gone down/sideways for 18months. I never hear a bear story.
So I was intrigued a few weeks ago when I long term bull told me he had cut exposure. The reason that the next generation of nuclear reactors uses a tiny fraction of the Uranium the old ones use. SMRs also use a tiny fraction. There are also competing technologies such as using Thorium where China already has a prototype up and running. Appreciate some of this stuff long way off. 
Just thought interesting counter argument to something most people evangelically bullish on.
[23/07/2025, 14:11:39] ~ Ben Finegold: Jason - we deal with these types of questions quite often. I think one thing to remember is prices have gone up 3.5x since 2019 and have as you say rebased at ~$70/lb. The issue is that we will not see $150/lb uranium in spot price terms until utilities come into the market - we cannot rely on traders swapping 100k lbs here 200k lbs there to really move the market. 

The bear story is that utilities continue to not budge - but one fact that is true is that the market has produced about 25-30% less than it consumes for 7 consecutive years. That has to end at some point and there are not 100s of idle uranium mines sat waiting for higher prices. There a very very few and the few (particularly in the U.S. + Paladin) that have come back online, have faced ramp up issues across the board. 

The SMR point I don’t love because the world needs more GW scale nuclear (traditional) than it does SMRs. Fermi are building an 11GW data centre, Stargate 5GW. You need a hell of a lot of SMRs to power those. Oklo reactors are 75MW! 

Yes there are many many use cases for SMRs outside of data centres but I think the market slightly forgets that the more pressing issue is for us to build GW scale nuclear that requires ~600k lbs of uranium per year. That’s what China are doing and they can see it like a beach ball. 

More than happy to chat offline if helpful.
[23/07/2025, 14:16:29] ~ Jason M: Thanks I am not trying to be clever.
I just guess if we did a straw poll of how many people are positive on uranium/nuclear on this chat 90% would be. If you had told me the news on nuclear over the last 18months I would have guessed uranium would have doubled yet here we are. Just makes me wonder what we are missing. Just feels like more money to be made in next generation stuff possibly than the commodity/miners. The bull story feels tired…but maybe I am just impatient.
[23/07/2025, 14:17:23] ~ Jason M: I don t remember any bears of lithium 2 years ago when everyone was trying to buy mines
[23/07/2025, 14:20:55] ~ Ben Finegold: Totally agree - while we have remained uranium bulls we moved towards advanced tech / niche players such as ASPI / LTBR 2 years ago. Rising tide and all that…I still wouldn’t touch OKLO with a barge poll. I have been continuously wrong about Centrus, shares have done phenomenally well but think that business model is broken given reliance on Russia. 

We made a strong call on UUUU a few weeks back given. Also Paladin looks nice at these levels. Shares -12% last night following a small miss at Langer Heinrich.

[23/07/2025, 17:38:00] ~ JB: I can’t think of any commodity where the price is up 4x from the low and there is has been very little supply side response. It is taking 12-15 years for new supply to come on stream.

Kazakhstan control 45% of the market and is a defacto OPEC for Uranium on its own.  The Prime Minister gets this and understands KAZ will benefit from higher prices.  We are taking about many many years. 

We spoke to CCJ recently they are now getting much higher floors and ceilings ($130-140) in their future contracts. If they don’t they don’t sign.

[24/07/2025, 08:54:59] ~ Robin Maxwell: 👀 Semiconductor Equipment - VAT Group (VACN - Mkt Cap CHF 9bn / Revs CHF 1bn) VAT has long been a mid cap darling within pan-euro semi space. Trading consistently at ca 10x revenue  and ca 35x forward p/e (and often much higher), VAT Group is the global dominant leader in vacuum valve technology for semiconductor manufacturing, with a market share of approximately 70-75%. For those watching this space it is worth noting that the stock was down 10% yesterday on weak 2Q order intake and a B2Bill below 1x. I am reasonably confident that this is a blip (poss tariff related) and especially if Semi manufacturing infrastructure is to be reshored and built in the US. The H1 FCF nearly doubled yoy to CHF51m but market didn't seem to care. I have dipped a couple of toes into VAT since the stock halved between July '24 and April '25. It had been recovering so this is a set back. Clearly a strong $ earner as well - the company lost 10% EBITDA growth in 1H due to FX ($) weakness. Constant FX EBITDA growth was 33% ...so still v healthy profit performance. There are clear reasons for capex on Semi equipment globally to continue to grow in coming years and its worth noting that VAT is a mission critical supplier to this key sector. Will be watching as inclination is to want to add more into this dip esp with allocators looking to add in Europe. One of the highest quality mid caps in Switzerland / Europe - a true global leader.

[24/07/2025, 13:13:41] ~ SSCOOK: IDR SM 1H25 results after close yesterday also- core thesis continuing to play out as Spanish conglomerate continues to transform itself into a defense company under new management. 

Defense order intake growth is picking up the pace: +90% 2Q, +50% 1H and book to bill is now pushing 1.5x (from 1x in 23 & 24). A big deal as moves them closer to the big boys  (sector best @2x +). Defense biz took more margin in 1H - impressive as already has one of the sectors best EBITDA margins already (~20%). Air Traffic business had a monster revenue 2Q.  No change to groups 2025 guidance but is set up well with contributions from impactful €725 million Hispasat deal (space/satellite) still to come and company remains debt free while looking for other deals.

Newly disclosed in the quarter was the break out of IndraMind their play of AI/Cyber into a separate unit. Combines elements of defense + consulting biz. They see has a potential €1bn revenue by 2030, 25-30% CGR 2025-30, 50/50 military vs civilian application. 

Hard to believe after IDR SM’s stock’s strong run (+40% since beg of April) that their defense biz is still highly discounted vs Euro defense sector (-25%) on an implied forward looking basis - this values their IT consulting biz Minsait at 6x (seems fair for low  growth, 8% margin). 

Nothing new in prepared statements on merger talks with Escribano Mechanical & Engineering (which is a 14% shareholder in IDR) and run by the brother of Angel Escribano (IDR’s Chairman). ‎<This message was edited>

Either the market was underwhelmed by both, or they simply weren’t enough to offset growing concerns: integration fatigue post-Refinitiv, surging capex, slowing data growth, and mounting regulatory risk. With synergy gains peaking and valuation stretched, any execution slip could prompt a sharp de-rating. Short sellers are focused on the EU clearing decision (Q4 2025) - if even 30% of €--denominated derivatives migrate to eurozone CCPs, LCH stands to lose £250–300m in revenue and, more importantly, its netting advantages - increasing capital requirements significantly. Given the binary risk ahead and growing negative sentiment, we’re reviewing LSEG and will be watching their earnings report closely next week.

Capex is clearly exploding in US AI, chips, data centres, green energy, manufacturing onshoring. Mag 7 capex alone according to Bessant is 1% on gdp. 
Europe going the same way with German fiscal stimulus, defence spend and all of the above and that is before we all talk about Ukraine rebuild. 
I would be interested if anyone disagrees this is the obvious theme.
Secondly what people’s favourite names of a sensible market cap size are say $5bn+. I sense some of the more obvious names tied specifically to AI and green energy may have run far enough and it spreads to more general construction names. Have a lack of US exposure.

[28/07/2025, 10:02:00] Nick finegold: Been thinking about Reddit ahead of numbers , which I owned and sold and currently have no exposure to. 

Reddit: Where Retail Rules. Not cheap but very interesting. 

We’re living through the most retail-driven market in history — a time when the tail wags the dog.

Every institutional desk is now tuned in to what retail traders are doing. But where do those signals originate? It’s No longer Bloomberg & CNBC that rocks a stick . It’s Reddit.

At the heart of it all is WallStreetBets — a subreddit with millions of followers, where narratives are born, options flow is dissected, and cult stocks are germinated. 

Reddit is deeply human.
It’s not polished. It’s not performative. It’s not bots liking bots. It’s raw, original content — from real people with real opinions.

That matters for two big reasons:
	1.	Advertisers want humans. Reddit offers authenticity at scale, not artificial engagement.
	2.	AI needs humans. When training large models, original user-generated content is gold dust. Reddit has a treasure trove of it.

As the retail investor becomes a market-moving force — and as AI and ad engines seek real-world training and targeting data — Reddit becomes a nexus of relevance.

It’s not just a community.
It’s a source code.
And in a retail-driven world, that makes it one of the most interesting platforms — and possibly stocks — on the planet.
[28/07/2025, 11:03:42] ~ Ed Farquhar: NCC Group: The UK Breakup Story Hiding in Plain Sight

What’s happening:
Manchester-based NCC Group (market cap: £460M) is quietly unlocking value the UK market has overlooked for years. With both its divisions now under strategic review, a sum-of-the-parts breakup could deliver 60p–90p of upside near term.

Why it matters:
UK takeovers have made headlines, but genuine breakups like Ascential (200p → 550p) have been even more lucrative. NCC is next in line.

⸻

🧱 The Business

NCC has two distinct divisions:
	1.	Escode – The world leader in software escrow
	2.	Cyber Security – One of the last pure-play listed cyber consultancies in London post-Darktrace

Each unit is now independently up for sale. The market hasn’t priced in their full value.

⸻

💾 Escode: One of the highest-quality earnings stories in the UK
	•	What it does: Think of Escode as insurance for mission-critical software. It stores code for 10,000+ clients (including 50% of the Fortune 500) and ensures access if vendors fail or go under.
	•	Revenue: ~£65M
	•	EBIT: ~£33M
	•	Margins: Best-in-class, capital-light, >50%
	•	Valuation range: £300M–£400M
	•	Buyer interest: Four PE firms reported circling
	•	Key edge: No significant competitor over £5M revenue. It’s a monopoly with regulation-driven demand and evergreen B2B contracts.

📈 Regulators now nudge companies to adopt escrow. Escode invented the category.

⸻

🔐 Cyber Security: Next in line
	•	Revenue: ~£250M
	•	Est. valuation: £300M–£400M
	•	Potential sale timeline: Before calendar year-end
	•	Strategic angle: Following Darktrace’s path to private ownership

📌 Together, the two businesses could unlock £600M–£800M in sale proceeds vs today’s £460M market cap.

⸻

🧠 Smart Money Involved

NCC’s shareholder register is a who’s who of UK small-cap Jedi:
	•	Richard Griffiths (14%)
	•	Harwood Capital (11%) – incl. Stuart Widdowson (ex-HG Capital)

📣 No weak hands. No structural sellers. Just a clean, experienced register of value-driven long-term holders.

⸻

📊 Bottom Line

With both divisions now on the block and high-quality buyers in play, NCC’s breakup story is real, active, and potentially explosive.

If Escode fetches £350M+ and Cyber hits £300M–£400M, a 200p–240p price target looks realistic.
That’s a 30%–65% upside from today — in months, not years.

⏳ Market’s asleep. But the deal clock is ticking.

I share an office with Harwood Capital and it is public knowledge that management are running a sale process of Escode.
[28/07/2025, 11:05:28] ~ Dipesh Patel: For those following Barclays which has been a core long, they report tomorrow. Hard to see them not reporting v well esp given where the curve has shifted to. That said, it's been v strong post the breakout, and since 1 July, financials are actually off a tad (relative) which I assume is purely profit taking on numbers from the US IBs. For me, the yield curve continues to be extremely favourable and I'd expect strong numbers and a continuation of the rerating

I am sure it can be justified by Paul Mann however the narrative has always been isotopes are scarce , in high demand and expensive so why do you need to invest in producing more.

[29/07/2025, 06:20:37] Nick finegold: The Metal Company 

Having listened to the  Ivanhoe mines CEO yesterday in a post that Matt shared and read various articles about whether Chilean Copper will be tariff free , it’s clear to me that the Trump administration feels similarly about copper as it does rare earths and all other metals it deems to be important to national security.
  
Now it’s hard to buy a stock that’s up 400% but I asked chat gpt this morning if the copper contained in polymetalic nodules is in concentrations that make it commercially viable to mine . 

This is the answer I got. 

🔋 Summary:

Yes, 1.1% copper is commercially attractive, especially in the context of the multi-metal revenue stream, lower overburden (no blasting or digging), and rising global demand for clean energy metals. The bigger hurdles are regulatory, ESG, and technological, not ore grade.

So this raises some interesting questions about whether this administration might do a MP Materials type deal with TMC or other providers of metals they deem to be highly significant. 

I have no idea, but what’s clear is that this administration if hell bent on supporting any businesses that can provide the US with supply chain security.  China has been playing this game for years and it’s clearly a priority that the US catches up .
[29/07/2025, 06:48:01] ~ Matt H: The amount of copper in nodules will be tiny.
[29/07/2025, 07:03:19] ~ Matt H: How much rock/nodule can you put on a ship per day? 3000t maybe. At 1.1% Cu. Assuming 90% recovery it’s not going to make a significant impact to the copper market.
[29/07/2025, 07:04:42] ~ Matt H: The US has a huge amount of copper in the ground. Permitting is the problem.
[29/07/2025, 07:13:42] ~ Matt H: Vitol Group handed a record $10.6 billion to its executives and senior staff through share buybacks last year, as the fallout of the energy crisis continued to deliver extraordinary riches to the world’s commodity traders.

The share repurchase — almost certainly the highest such payout in the industry’s history — means privately held Vitol has distributed over $31 billion to its partners in the past decade, according to the company’s audited annual accounts seen by Bloomberg News.

The numbers show how the disruptions that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have handed a spectacular bonanza to a small group of commodity traders that their predecessors could only have dreamed of. Vitol has paid out more through buybacks in the past three years than in the previous 17 years combined.

The world’s largest commodity trading house, the company is owned by 450-500 of its employees, a senior executive told a New York court last year. Based on that number, the 2024 payout would represent an average of over $20 million per partner, with some top executives and traders likely having received multiples of that.

The results also cement Vitol’s position as the most profitable commodity trading house by far: its net profit for the year of $8.7 billion was more than the combined profits of its four closest rivals, Glencore Plc, Trafigura Group, Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. and Gunvor Group.

Still, the huge payout comes as earnings are moderating across the industry. Vitol’s buyback in 2024 outstripped its profit for the year, meaning that the group’s equity dropped from $32.5 billion at the end of 2023 to $30.7 billion at the end of 2024.
[29/07/2025, 07:15:14] ~ Matt H: Interesting that most Vitol traders are in London but Vitol are the only company in the U.K. that has a special tax scheme meaning employees pay Swiss income tax rates ‎<This message was edited>
[29/07/2025, 07:38:58] ~ Jerry de Leeuw: Quite some other commodity trading firms have a tax deal with the Dutch government. And oil giants. My company for proving services to Aramco in the KSA is invoicing to their entity in The Hague. Number of people working there is just ‘a hand full’. 
Lately the Durch approach has been slipping, explaining why Shell and Unilever have bent completely to UK.

Nowadays, when you type a search term into Google, the first page no longer shows useful results, but mostly ads. And a few scams.

The endless stream of advertisements on Instagram, the countless tricks used to avoid showing people the lowest price, YouTube seemingly wanting to show nothing but ads… It’s not just a source of daily frustration, but a real cause for concern: what’s going on? Is the internet truly falling apart?

The American activist and writer Cory Doctorow coined a term that captures in a single word what’s wrong with the internet: enshittification.

Doctorow didn’t just come up with the term enshittification to describe what’s going wrong with the internet; he also provided a thorough analysis of how it’s come to this. Why the major American tech companies are able to enshittify their products without consequence, and why we keep using them anyway. Because the classic economic idea (that if a product or service deteriorates, the free market will naturally make room for better alternatives) clearly no longer applies in the digital economy.
[29/07/2025, 08:13:52] ~ Dipesh Patel: Barclays looks v solid, but as mentioned yesterday may well be ripe for profit taking in line with the pack. Jaws look great and Q2 specifically is v decent but a large part of the +35% eps is also buybacks and the headline beat of 5% is...  meh! I am not personally selling, but probably not enough to support continuation of the recent strong momentum here. Longer term it is starting to be better and better run in my view and most likely gets to £6-7 per share over a 3-4 year period.

[29/07/2025, 10:08:03] ~ Conor Moylan: This is where the Meta Glasses are heading: Meta Orion glasses. The technology is incredible. It's like having your smartphone projected into the real world, all powered by extremely sophisticated AI. But the cost hasn't come down enough yet to make them commercially viable yet.

Oppenheimer analyst on cnbc just now, says he is raising his target price to 800.

NUTSTUFF : The Mkt is somewhat churning and dull right now, and the Portfolio bar-bell is working thankfully with some Energy exposure helping. 
The next 24hrs I sense will decide which tack we sail on for next few weeks.  What I DO feel passionately is that more than ever this next decade will be the golden decade of Digital assets/ Blockchain Protocols and of course Bitcoin, with greater Institutional adoption and a 40% CAGR, dropping down to @24% in 2035.
A HUGE day for Markets & Macro. The strategic BTC reserve report is the real wildcard here - this could be the catalyst that breaks Bitcoin out of its consolidation around $118k. PCE data will set the tone for the Fed meeting. If we get softer inflation prints, it strengthens the case for that September rate cut. Lower rates = risk-on environment = crypto benefits. MSFT and META earnings I sense matter more than people think. Big tech cash flows often correlate with institutional crypto appetite. If they're printing money, some of that eventually finds its way into digital assets. The timing is perfect with Bitcoin sitting just 4% off ATH at $118k. If the strategic reserve report is even remotely positive, combined with dovish Fed signals, you could see a breakout above $122k resistance. The 98 companies that have raised $43B+ for crypto purchases since June are waiting for exactly this kind of macro clarity. Additionally, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to report its earnings tomorrow, Thursday, July 31, 2025,  Bears will point out: Volatility has collapsed & CTA long exposure is at the 100th percentile, implying that systematic funds have little room left to buy. At the same time the US dollar is turning, removing the primary liquidity driver of this rally At the same time Oil prices are turning up anticipating a new episode of war brewing in the Middle East.  Elsewhere I just went through the OAKLEY CAPITAL / OCI LN numbers, an NAV +7% is solid, but Time-Out seems to be THE issue. (More to come on this) On NOVO NORDISK, no way for me, still feels like a falling knife!                                                            https://nutstuff.co.uk/disclaimer

Paul Mann will talk about Pet Labs and his medical isotopes business and the contract ASPI has signed with IsoBio. 

Additionally:

Moore's Law is dead without Silicon 28 and ASPI now has capacity to build over 80kg of S28 pa which is going to be a key input for the semiconductor industry
Ytterbium 176 - ASPI is about to ship its 1st commercial Y176 to the likes of Novartis for cancer drugs
Carbon 14 and Carbon 12 - ASPI is about to ship 1st commercial production
QLE - HALEU fuel supplier for SMRs will be spun off before year end
Renergen - ASPI is close to closing its purchase of the best helium asset in the world, with over $500m of funding from the US DOD.  It is being bought for 14.27m shares ($133m @ current price) vs NPV of circa $3bn
ASPI is getting demand for to supply additional isotopes


The call will focus on their medical isotope business but there will be a chance for general Q&A.

[30/07/2025, 20:15:06] ~ Giles Fitzpatrick: According to Perplexity AI: Historical analysis and multiple sources on copper market volatility indicate that, in the last 50 years, copper has not experienced a single-day drop of 20% or more. While the metal is known for extreme volatility and there have been multi-day or multi-week plunges greater than 20%—notably during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and in spring 2025—no record indicates that copper’s price has ever fallen 20% or more in a single trading day over this period.
For example:
	•	In 2008, copper fell nearly 70% over six months, but this prolonged decline did not include any day with a single-session drop of 20%.
	•	The most volatile sessions in copper history, such as May 2006 and several days during 2025’s tariff-induced bear market, included single-day drops or spikes in the 7–13% range, but not at or above 20%.
	•	Even during the “worst setback ever” in the copper market, the sharpest daily moves remained well below 20%

[30/07/2025, 21:08:40] ~ Andrew Cawker: As I understand it the Comex fall (20%) is a reflection of the recent stock building in the US ahead of expected tariffs on the refined metal. (Comex is a US centric benchmark). So this fall burns off the premium created recently vs LME. 

I think that the test will be the LME price tomorrow (the global benchmark for physical copper).

Meta & Microsoft: AI Supercharged. Margins Exploded.

🧠 What’s happening: Both Meta and Microsoft smashed expectations in their June quarters, driven by AI-fueled efficiency, margin expansion, and robust enterprise demand.

⸻

Meta (META)
EPS beat big. Cost discipline even bigger.
	•	EPS: $7.14 vs. $5.89 est. (+38%)
	•	Revenue: $47.5B (+22%) vs. $44.8B est.
	•	Margins: Operating margin soared 500bps Y/Y to 43% — despite rising headcount (+7%) and AI spend.
	•	User base: 3.48B daily active people (+6%), ahead of 3.42B est.
	•	Ad growth: Driven by +11% more impressions and +9% higher pricing.
	•	Q3 guide: $49B revenue at midpoint vs. $46B est.
	•	2026 warning: Meta flags “meaningful upward pressure” on future costs — particularly depreciation and comp.
	•	Capex: 2025 range unchanged at $66–72B. 2026? A jaw-dropping ~$100B vs. $80B Street est.

💥 Bottom line: A monster quarter — but 2026 cost guidance might spook longer-term models.

⸻

Microsoft (MSFT)
Cloud king. Margin machine. Nothing to nitpick.
	•	EPS: $3.65 vs. $3.37 est. (+24%)
	•	Revenue: $76.4B (+18%) vs. $73.9B est.
	•	Operating income: $34.3B vs. $32.1B est.
	•	Margin: 45%, up 200bps Y/Y
	•	Azure: +39% growth — a 400bps acceleration Q/Q, and way ahead of 34.2% est.
	•	Bookings: Commercial bookings surged +30% (from +17% in Q3)
	•	RPO (backlog): $368B, up from $315B
	•	Capex (cash): $17.1B, up 23%
	•	Free cash flow: $25.6B vs. $21.1B est.

✅ Bottom line: Flawless. The only caution flag is valuation — everything else screams dominance.

EBay - popped 10% on numbers . International beat US domestic . This thing is cheap and has bought back 60% of its shares and is throwing off cash on 14x .

Very long statement - One figure really stands out - Operating income/tonne (US$/t) risen yoy from $75 to $140. All looks palatable to this small shareholder. Stock -4% at open on ST demand downgrade but 'Free cash flow is expected to be positive in 2025, supported by a release of working capital in 2H 2025' that feels positive to me after all capex/M&A. Analysts look like they expected that however.

[31/07/2025, 10:09:14] ~ William Nutting: So…
“Two stocks: (following on from GOOGL last week) Microsoft and Meta, just grew after-hours by more than the entire market cap of Europe. Read that again. The entire continent, from Lisbon to Lublin, from fondue to fjords, just got vaporised by a couple of men in hoodies and quarter-zips hitting “post” on their earnings.   The reason is one word: acceleration. First, revenue – galloping away like a Saudi racehorse on methamphetamine. Then, costs – left behind, bewildered, waving politely like a Victorian aunt at the station. The twittersphere & Wall Street, naturally, has gone delirious. The mood is late‑1999 all over again: “Spend what you like, boys. If it’s AI, it’s holy. Build the servers, melt the chips, pave the desert. There is no such thing as too much.”  Meta – Zuckerberg, the world’s most successful dorm-room stoic – idly drops $18 billion of quarterly net income. Stock rockets 10%, market cap $1.7 trillion. Microsoft – Nadella, a smiling assassin in chinos – posts $27 billion and adds the GDP of Spain to its valuation overnight. MicroStrategy? About to announce $15 billion. Valued at $110 billion. In this market, it might as well be wearing a sandwich board reading “Kick me.”  Even Seagate, purveyor of the world’s dullest disks, suddenly looks like a s@x stock. And then there’s quantum computing – a subject that sounds like a bad Marvel sequel but has just been blessed by Satya Nadella himself. Cue the stampede into IONQ and anything else vaguely quark-shaped. And Apple? Oh, dear. Once the high priest of taste, now the dowager duchess of Cupertino. Tim Cook stands there in his perfectly ironed nothingness, clutching AirPods like rosary beads, mumbling about “services revenue” while the rest of tech drives a flaming, AI‑powered Ferrari through his front door. The market’s verdict is clear: accelerate or die. And don’t bother slowing down for the corpses.”

[31/07/2025, 12:04:41] ~ Ben Finegold: Cameco Q2 Reaction 

Going through CCJ numbers now. At first glance not much in there you don't already know. Westinghouse guidance has been increased in line with the $170m CEZ contract they won during the Q but market reacting favourably to this with shares +3% pre market.

Note uranium inventories down ~30% during the Q from 11.2m lbs to 7.5m lbs. This is interesting...note the world's largest producer KAP has inventories at decade lows as well. We will dig into this some more.

Production guidance remains in line for the year although we do note that CCJ have warned about potential changes to this which is not something we have seen before:

"Our 2025 production outlook assumes ground freezing and development in new mining areas advance as planned, that we maintain access to adequate skilled labour, and that new equipment is commissioned on time."

Nothing to report on Inkai and market purchase obligations are unchanged at 3m lbs for the year. We might get more colour on this when KAP report tomorrow but CCJ do note potential for disruption from ongoing sulphuric acid shortages in the CIS region.

Despite weak contract volumes in the first half of the year CCJ note:

"we continue to have a large and growing pipeline of business under discussion, and as the pace of contracting improves, we expect to selectively continue layering in long-term volumes that capture greater future upside and downside protection using market-related pricing mechanisms."

[31/07/2025, 15:48:12] ~ William Nutting: Hi all.
Remains focus:
CRDL US/ Cardiol is a $123 million biotech that just might have stumbled into the cardiac equivalent of El Dorado. Next week it will publish Phase 2 data in acute myocarditis – and management, usually as talkative as a Trappist monk, are practically humming with confidence. When biotech execs start looking smug, you either short them for hubris or buy them for glory. Here, it’s glory. Why? Because acute myocarditis is the last unclaimed frontier of cardiology. There is no approved drug, no standard of care – just supportive therapy and prayer. Its cousin, recurrent pericarditis, has one approved drug – Arcalyst – a toxic little brute owned by Kiniksa that still manages a $2 billion market. Cardiol’s molecule, by contrast, looks cleaner and could take both indications. Call pericarditis $2B; acute myocarditis could be more. If the FDA fast‑tracks this – and it should, given the gaping therapeutic hole – Cardiol goes from penny dreadful to market belle overnight. And that’s before you mention the heart failure programme – promising in mice, and already whispered about in Novo Nordisk corridors (yes, that Novo).  This is what makes the current valuation – $123 million – feel like a misprint. The market is valuing a cardiac goldmine like a forgotten AIM oil driller. If pericarditis alone is worth $2B, myocarditis is diamonds. The set‑up is binary, yes, but gloriously asymmetric: data next week, upside if right, and possibly the biotech trade of the year if the whisper mill proves true. WN.

[31/07/2025, 22:42:33] ~ William Nutting: “Marmite Mike”  Saylors MicroStrategy / MSTR’s results just arrived not so much as an earnings report, but more as a cosmic middle finger to everyone who doubted that buying a digital figment could actually become a corporate religion. 
It’s not just a beat — it’s a beat so frikking biblical it should come with incense and a choir. $32.60 EPS versus a negative 7cents expected. 
This is what happens when you bet the company on Bitcoin and the world obliges by going mad enough to make you right. 
On Operating income? $14 billion. Net income? $10 billion. They’ve made so much money this quarter you can almost hear Warren Buffett grinding his dentures in Omaha. And then, in a feat of hubris usually reserved for Roman emperors and Elon Musk, they’re raising another $4.2 billion to buy even more Bitcoin. Because if you’ve won in the casino, why leave the table?
MSTR now own 628,791 Bitcoin— a hoard so vast it’s less a balance sheet item than a geopolitical weapon, and at an average cost of $73,277 a coin. 
On Year-to-date yield? 25 per cent. They’ve conjured $13.2 billion out of thin digital air. And then there is guidance: $80 EPS for the year. That’s not guidance; that’s a gauntlet thrown at the feet of every CFO still faffing about with share buybacks and “AI initiatives.”  
Even the stock issuance policy reads like scripture: no dilution below 2.5x NAV, a sprinkling above 4.0x. The kind of discipline that turns cynics into cult members. 
Honesty this isn’t finance anymore. It’s theatre. It’s religion. It’s the moment a company stopped being a company and became a vault, a vessel, and a very loud argument that the old rules of money are increasingly dead.  ( NUTSTUFF).

[01/08/2025, 08:42:54] ~ David Haysey: Remember the daily mining output of BTC is only about 450 with the next ‘halving’ likely in 2028. 450 is roughly $50m/day. It feels rather cornerish. And unlike other famous corners (like silver) the authorities don’t appear to be incentivised to stop it-if anything the reverse as the grifters are the authorities. Recommending stuff on the basis of ‘there’s a corner under way’ is usually the stuff of market tops but I’m still inclined to buy. You can write ‘this time is different’ on my gravestone……
‎[01/08/2025, 08:47:41] ~ William Nutting: ‎image omitted
[01/08/2025, 09:00:47] ~ Charlie Morris: At current prices, bitcoin miners are paid $20 billion per year plus fees (~6%). That’s high and weighs on price but recall gold is 20x that and that works fine. As bitcoin network grows, it becomes easier to absorb the network cost, plus halving. That reduces the cost by 50% by 2028 and 75% by 2032. Strong tailwind. Institutional investors have low exposure but will grow significantly so market can take it. I feel the supply cost is often overlooked and explains why 10x moves become more difficult as market cap moves into the trillions.
[01/08/2025, 09:14:22] Nick finegold: That is also reflected in lower volatility which shows up in Coinbase’s numbers

[01/08/2025, 12:24:30] ~ William Nutting: Fyi to all those following HELIUM/ HNT. 
Weakness attributable to “halving”..

Helium’s halving is when the number of new HNT tokens created — and paid to network participants — is cut in half. It happens every two years and is designed to make the token scarcer over time, similar to Bitcoin. For miners, it means fewer rewards unless demand for the network (and the token) rises. For investors, it’s seen as a potential catalyst for price — supply drops while usage, in theory, keeps growing.

No strong view here but saw below on another chat...

Some see the progress made in  Congress  in regulating digital currencies as a potential negative for COIN, rather than a positive, as the company has said.
"More regulatory certainty is going to invite competition from non-crypto-native brokers, which we expect to be a catalyst for price compression," wrote Raymond James analyst  Patrick O'Shaughnessy  in a note to clients.

Also, my punter friend who called the recent top says that '  One of the reasons I am bearish on COIN. Basically, their fees/bid-ask spreads are just crazy ' .

[02/08/2025, 17:01:37] ~ Philip Donald: We Trump critics cannot be blind to his successes
It pains me to say it, as one of Donald Trump’s many “foam-at-the-mouth critics”, says Bret Stephens in The New York Times, but his presidency is becoming more and more successful. He has strong-armed other Nato members into upping their defence spending, something his predecessors always wanted but were too polite to do anything about. He defied parts of his political base to help Israel neuter Iran’s nuclear programme, without getting drawn into another Middle East war. After his initial pressure campaign on Ukraine only emboldened Vladimir Putin, he changed course and accelerated the delivery of arms to Kyiv – a welcome demonstration that he can change his mind when the facts change.
Back home, Trump has ended America’s migration crisis (albeit going too far by targeting law-abiding illegal immigrants). The economy has – so far – shrugged off concerns about his tariff regime. The Democrats are polling at a 35-year low. Yes, there is still plenty to “fear, dislike and even despise” about what this administration does: threatening to seize allies’ territory; shaking down universities and law firms; promoting “medical quackery”. But if we Trump critics want to be effective – “and let’s face it, we haven’t been” – we have to acknowledge reality. Namely, that not everything he does is bad; that his “bad manners” and over-the-top approach sometimes achieve useful diplomatic results. I’ve repeatedly lambasted this president and this administration, and I’m sure I’ll do so again. But you have to give credit where it’s due. “For criticism to be credible, it cannot be blind.”

[03/08/2025, 07:16:23] Nick finegold: Interesting article , we often talk about Nuclear as non intermittent base load power . Not this summer ! Hydro & Nuclear were saved by solar as reactors were shut down and energy demand soared due to heat waves.

[03/08/2025, 07:16:42] Nick finegold: Then If I could ask everyone to watch/listen to this podcast from Eric Schmidt . It’s measured and insightful .

The first few mins are very powerul. 

~ The limit of ai will governed by access to cheap electricity not chips. Electricity supply is what will hold back ai. 

We all know hyoerscalers are falling over themselves to gain capacity , but the clear message is it  wont arrive in time or sufficient quantities, as the velocity of ai outstrips our capacity to build new base load power. This is profoundly important for numerous sectors , utilities, chips , infrastructure, metals etc . 

This impending market dislocation is why I will subscribe to the geothermal deal that Ocean Wall are doing with Nikon and Schlumberber. It could be geothermals fracking moment . 

Geothermal is quick to market and largely unfollowed by market practioners . Whether it can make a dent in the demand side of the equation is my only question.

Numerous other positives and negatives to weigh up on ai in the podcast . if you can afford the time. 

Have a great weekend and please give it a listen.

[05/08/2025, 07:57:33] ~ Robin Maxwell: BP CEO - just on Bloomberg. Impressive. Oil discovery Brazil yesterday quantified as largest oil discovery this century. Talking cash flows rising from £8bn - £14bn over coming 3-4 years. Talking demand growth in 2025 and 2026 at +1% pa as in past two decades. Sees 2026 demand increment from petrochemicals. Sees price impact mostly influenced by potential sanctions on Iran, Russia and Chinese storage levels. Talking up imminent arrival of new Chair ex CRH and his record in creating shareholder value. No current plans to do a CRH style shift to NYSE - reminder that 60% of the biz in USA - all renewables activities from here to be off-balance sheet partnerships - de-risk capital exposure for BP shareholders. Sees non-opec supply flat from Jan-Feb 26 onward. Assuming flat $65-70 oil ...this feels like a clear buy to me.

Yesterday I thought it very significant we were the ONLY 1 Major Economy to put our NET ZERO by 2030 “PARIS exam papers in on time”. Everyone else has given up on Carbon zero Net by 2030, but no Milband is intent on keeping the UK’s Industrial energy at 7x CHINAS and 5x USA’s prices. As long as Ed Miliband tries to make Ideology & policy run faster than technology, and as above, NO other countries follow Britain’s lead on climate change, decarbonisation will simply mean deindustrialisation. This also locks us out of the Digital Economy so every time you hear a Blabbing Politician tell them to STFU!

[05/08/2025, 09:35:50] Nick finegold: In a weird way the energy transition is probably in the best shape it’s ever been simply because the hyoerscalers demand for electricity is now so vast that it has rekindled , nuclear , geothermal and possibly even hydrogen with demand for all sources of zero carbon power at scale now required. That of course includes oil and gas but it was only through real scale that the market was ever going to  conquer the carbon problem . We now need literally trillions of $ of investment in power to drive the new economy which is actually being driven by economic necessity not green washing . So we might get there faster than planned but for a very different set of reasons. ‎<This message was edited>
[05/08/2025, 09:44:11] Nick finegold: 3 names to watch into earnings all
of which I am long . 

Marex - has been impacted by Trump talk on lower rates but should have record numbers based on market volatility. It’s pulled back 20% . 

E toro - my play on retail frenzy in stocks and shares, it’s also been benign post IPO due to competititive threat of HOOD. 


Pinterest - I spoke to this  group about Reddit pre numbers ( which we had put into our top 10 thematic stocks to own ) and it went up 50% post the numbers in 3 days which was remarkable. 

I am hoping that ai has a similar impact on Pinterest numbers  which are due in a couple of days. Safe content, 70% female demographic and it’s always had problems monetising its 570m subscribers. If ai helps improve its Average revenue per user , ( as it has has with all other ad platforms ) it could surprise very positively. ‎<This message was edited>

[05/08/2025, 13:32:02] ~ Ben Finegold: For those who bought the Embraer (ERJ) dip…

Brazilian planemaker Embraer EMBR3.SA on Tuesday reaffirmed its 2025 outlook and said U.S. tariffs did not significantly affect its second-quarter results, even as it described the levies as a "major concern" amid ongoing trade uncertainties.

The company avoided a potential setback last week when U.S. President Donald Trump exempted aircraft from a 50% tariff imposed on U.S. imports from Brazil, but still faces a 10% duty first imposed in April, which it indicated was harmful but manageable.

As it reported its April-June earnings, Embraer said it advocates for a "swift return to zero tariff rules for all aviation and aerospace industries" and again sought to underscore its ties to the U.S., including local jobs and investments.
Embraer, whose E175 narrowbody is a workhorse of U.S. regional aviation, flagged last month that a 50% tariff from its No. 1 market could have triggered order cancellations, deferred deliveries and hammered its revenue like the pandemic did.

Following last week's relief, Embraer now reiterated it expects to deliver between 77 and 85 commercial aircraft this year, and 145 to 155 executive jets. Full-year net revenue is forecast to hit $7 billion to $7.5 billion.

The company on Tuesday posted an adjusted net loss of $4.7 million for the period, down from a profit of $80.4 million a year earlier, weighed by a net change in deferred income tax and social contribution.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) reached $245.5 million, up from $190.4 million a year earlier. Net revenue came in at $1.82 billion, a 22% year-on-year increase.

[05/08/2025, 15:59:33] Nick finegold: Interesting, thanks for posting . We have learnt to live with this aspect of the market .  Evlv , bear attack . It’s now doubled , Osi systems bear attack , it’s done brilliantly and it’s been forgotten about . 

Smci , there was some merit around governance etc . 

The only thing one can do is the go away and do the work.  

Funnily enough I was reading the Marex q1 quarterly statement this morning , I noticed this . 

“As you can see on Slide 16, we continue to maintain prudent levels of surplus capital and liquidity, which support our investment-grade credit ratings with both S&P and Fitch. Our total capital ratio of 234%, well above the minimum required levels, and liquid headroom of over $1 billion, ensure that we're well positioned for periods of market turmoil.”
[05/08/2025, 16:07:20] Nick finegold: Oh and let’s not forget the bear attack on Aspi as well . 

These are unpleasant events but most ( not all)  are short term speculators cashing in ) as always we will go away speak to the company await mature responses , do the work. and revert . But one of the reasons we like Marex is it’s always been a very low risk agency execution business that thrives on volume .
[05/08/2025, 16:13:33] ~ Robin Maxwell: Finally went through Spotify 2Q release and note for 3Q " We are also forecasting ARPU to be flat Y/Y on a constant currency basis". They are forecast flat qoq revs also with $200m currency headwind (although that's based on $ rate at end 2Q and it strengthened since). All seems quite conservative given the growth of video, DJ product, new Gen AI driven algo and forecast of 5m sub growth in 3Q QoQ etc etc. But ultimately I believe it will have to a be rising ARPU on rising subs that drive the stock to $800 +, so we may have to wait a while.
[05/08/2025, 17:43:52] Nick finegold: A couple of quotes  for members to focus on from Marex’s last quarterly statement until the company can craft a response . 

It’s in a closed period which is why this is a smart time to launch a bear attack. 


	•	Balance sheet conservatism: Total capital ratio stands at 234% — well above regulatory requirements — with over $1 billion in liquid headroom. The majority of assets are high-quality liquid instruments supporting client activity.
	•	Credit quality: Investment-grade ratings from both Fitch and S&P were reaffirmed in 2024, underpinned by low leverage, minimal net debt, and prudent liquidity management.
	•	Institutional confidence: The first post-IPO shareholder sell-down was met with strong demand, increasing free float to 52% and broadening the institutional shareholder base.
	•	Prudent risk management: Average daily VaR in Market Making remains low at $3.2 million, with no directional trading book and proactive credit risk management leading to net provision releases in 2024.

I have never seen such an abomination of the game as this. The scoreboard doesn’t even show who the bowler or batter is. My kids have no idea what’s going on other than fireworks or loud music. As an MCC member I will be writing a letter protesting about the home of cricket entertaining the 100.

The original owners of T20 franchises have made huge financial gains. The Hundred however should be tinned. It really is dire.

[06/08/2025, 13:00:48] ~ William Nutting: CARDIOL / CRDL US: We finally have the Phase 2 Acute Myocarditis. The results were AMAZING! I am told more details to follow.
Highlights here: The Company will now have a second drug in phase 3 heart disease. I cant say much more at the moment on the press release which is limited in detail. I suspect for a very good reason.

image
A thesis reminder: CARDIOL is a $110 million biotech that just might have stumbled into the cardiac equivalent of El Dorado. Acute myocarditis is heart failure for young people, by the way, not the sort of creaky coronary you get after 50 years of too much lager and chips. No treatment exists. None. Zero. Which makes the potential market vast. Meanwhile, their other heart drug, for recurrent pericarditis, is already in Phase 3. And if this one works, they’ll push into general heart failure, these are the big leagues. Three swings at multi‑billion‑dollar diseases, and yet the whole company’s worth about as much as a small semi‑detached in Croydon. Again, Acute myocarditis is a cruel, capricious affliction that ambushes the young, the fit and the ones who haven’t yet learned to distrust their own bodies. There is no approved drug, no standard of care just supportive therapy and prayer. Its cousin, recurrent pericarditis, has one approved drug Arcalyst, a toxic and expensive little brute owned by Kiniksa that still manages a $2 billion market. Cardiol’s molecule, by contrast, looks cleaner and could take both indications. Call pericarditis $2B; acute myocarditis could be more.  If the FDA fast‑tracks this  and it should, given the gaping therapeutic hole,  Cardiol goes from being a penny dreadful to a market rock-star overnight. And that’s before you mention the heart failure programme, promising in mice, and already whispered about in certain well-respected much larger corridors! This is what makes the current valuation $123 million feel like a misprint. The market is valuing a cardiac goldmine like a forgotten AIM oil driller. If pericarditis alone is worth $2B, myocarditis is diamonds. The set‑up is binary, yes, but gloriously asymmetric. Boo‑hoo, biotech’s hard, but Nutstuff loves asymmetric alpha and this remains very possibly a significant biotech trade.

Throwing its toys out the pram because CardiolRx missed a made‑up statistical line in the sand – p=0.0538 instead of 0.05. Boo hoo. In real life, the drug actually shrank inflamed hearts — literally took swollen cardiac muscle and made it smaller — which is about as “working” as medicine gets. But investors want fireworks and ticker‑tape parades.
The pericarditis trial’s still marching on, safety’s clean, and management haven’t had to rewrite the playbook. Yet the stock trades like someone’s found arsenic in the pill bottle. Acute myocarditis kills young people; this is one of the only shots on goal. Missing by a hair isn’t failure — it’s foreplay.

[06/08/2025, 23:06:49] ~ Jonny Haycock: Very interesting that it appears the Fed is actively considering the financial and accounting implications of revaluing their gold reserves. The case studies cited, however, illustrate that it rarely alters a country’s structural problems. And in the US case, the sky high debt would of course still dwarf any positive impact from revaluing reserves to current prices. Maybe they think about revaluing to a big premium to prevailing prices? Who knows. But the fact it appears to being genuinely considered by the Fed is noteworthy.

[07/08/2025, 09:28:39] Calum Curation: As of this morning Shaftesbury Capital (FTSE250, £3bn mkt cap) is a new Curation Connect client. Shaftesbury owns a rare collection of c640 heritage assets in high-footfall, globally recognised areas mainly in Covent Garden and Soho. There is also a rent reversion story with about a quarter of the estate under rented. Despite the high quality assets, over £1bn of liquidity and debt halving recently post a JV with Norges, the shares oddly trade at a 25% discount to NAV. Worth a look!

[07/08/2025, 18:53:18] ~ William Nutting: CROX US -27%!
CROCS: I did this for my eldest into numbers as she works there in investor relations. 

…
Numbers are due today! “Crocs are not shoes. Not really. They are the Platonic ideal of anti-shoes, rubbery confessionals for people who’ve given up caring what their feet look like. They are also, improbably, a billion‑dollar empire. The plastic clogs that launched a thousand sneers are now so popular they’ve been franchised into Hey Dude, a brand which sounds like a children’s cartoon about a cowboy with unresolved emotional issues, but is in fact another casual shoe business.  Together they form a phenomenon that no self-respecting fashion critic would admit to understanding and yet, in the arithmetic of Wall Street, they’re gorgeous. The margins are fat, the cash pours in, and the growth, even with Hey Dude’s wobble, has kept the company squarely in the footwear aristocracy. This Thursday’s earnings aren’t about whether Crocs will sell more foam clogs (they will, they always do); it’s about whether Hey Dude can stop being the slightly embarrassing younger brother at the family reunion and start pulling its weight. If the numbers surprise on the upside, the co & analysts will dress it up in jargon about “channel inventory normalisation” and “DTC penetration”. But really, it’s simpler than that: ugly shoes might still be a beautiful business.”

[08/08/2025, 06:50:08] ~ William Nutting: Another day and another curved ball…
Trump tarrifs Swiss Gold bars! Yes the ones COMEX uses! 

There’s always been something reassuringly adult about gold. It doesn’t promise, it doesn’t tweet, it doesn’t explain itself. It just is dense, indifferent, and quietly universal. It has no quarterly earnings, no roadmap, no sudden forks in the night. And for 5,000 years, it has arguably never been someone else’s liability. Bitcoin, by contrast, is gold’s adolescent cousin charming, unruly, brilliant at parties, terrible in a crisis. It lives in your phone, not your vault. It doesn’t tarnish, but it does crash. It’s democratic, decentralised, and just unstable enough to feel exciting like a libertarian rave held in a volcano. And now along comes the Orange Orangutan Trump, with all the subtlety of a bull in a central bank, slapping a 39% tariff on Swiss kilo and 100 oz gold bars the exact bars COMEX uses to settle physical contracts. A golden brick lobbed at the windows of Bretton Woods. Remind yourself again of the asset that Trump owns?!! Gold may still be the sanctuary for many, but Bitcoin is starting to look like the escape hatch.
[08/08/2025, 07:02:10] ~ David Haysey: A child could arbitrage its way out of this provided it had access to a furnace and secure transport. This is prime time TV ratings driven nonsense. Nixon killed Bretton Woods. Trump doesn’t need to do anything. The gold price reaction tells all we need to know.
[08/08/2025, 07:49:55] Nick finegold: A couple
Of club names reported last night , both beat but with very different share price reactions in the after market. 

Ouster ( +20% ) came
In top end of the range $35m of revs , best quote I could
Find from the call was,  

“Ouster is at the very early innings of Physical AI, automation, propagating into every moving machine on earth. And so at the scale that we're operating, 4,000 to 5,000 units plus a quarter, it doesn't take many customers each quarter to significantly expand our volumes and our shipments. “ 

The US military and government is going to be one of those very large customers as is the autonomous driving industry. Still needs to turn profitable but ouster leads the way in this space of warehouse automation and numerous other verticals. 



Pinterest also beat on almost every metric . ( -10% in the after market ) . Maybe they  needed to beat the beat.  Nothing wrong with the numbers or outlook  , let’s see where they open . Ai enhancing pins ads , improving arpu and even MAU grew 11% which when you are at almost 600m users is impressive . International improving , gen z rocking up on the platform .  Genuinely good all round numbers and decent outlook , I guess expectations were too high. 

Best quote from the call .

“It's abundantly clear that Pinterest is an AI winner. We've never been more popular or valued by our users and more performance for our advertisers. Our Q2 results clearly showcased that our increased product velocity, combined with our consistent execution against our multiple ways to win is leading to durable growth. We ended the quarter with 578 million MAUs and a 11% increase year-over- year, marking yet another quarter of record high users.

At the same time, we generated Q2 revenue of $998 million, up 17% year-over-year as we continue to be a vital partner for advertisers across a range of verticals seeking to reach our lean to end users. “
[08/08/2025, 08:46:23] ~ Richard Windsor: Ouster is also becoming the only Western maker of Lidars of any significance. The other is Chinese and is many times its size. Luminar is in difficulty. This also means that those that dont want to use Chinese software for the eyes of their machines will have few other places to go.  

Share count is also quitely growing (like Palantir) from the ATM facility the company has and it has raised $59m so far this year. share count now 54m.

The valuation is challenging but narrative and momentum are in the driving seat. I have no idea when to sell.
[08/08/2025, 09:02:35] Nick finegold: Yes . I noticed that too Rich , thanks for pointing it out . From what I can tell they sold $54m of a $100m facility.

[08/08/2025, 12:44:45] ~ William Nutting: NUTSTUFF’s “RUSSIA Proxies & Portfolio Plays for Peace”: I have had this basket for a few months as am ever hopeful for peace.  NBIS US (Yandex) VEON (telco) WIZZ RWE & ARCELOR-MITTAL. 
Also via Turkish listings: Russias Biggest Brewery: AEFES TI. (3x PE) Russias largest Mall: ENKAI TI. Then there is ARCLK TI who bought the Russian assets of Whirlpool making 2.8m refrigerators and dish washers. 
                                                     
A Huge move yesterday in NEBIUS: (the old Russia/Yandex) Mkt cap of $15bn. As an analyst I spoke to wrote: Yesterdays move might just be the ignition sequence before 🚀! 
HERE’S THE NBIS PITCH AGAIN: “You want peace in Ukraine?  Nebius isn’t just in that war they’re building the bl**dy battlefield.” 
“NEBIUS has scarcity, the CEO a Russian tech founder who didn’t end up flogging dodgy crypto or poisoned underpants. Instead, Arkady Volozh the man who built Yandex into Russia’s answer to Google, Amazon and most of Silicon Valley before breakfast, left the Kremlin, took a few hundred genius engineers with him, and built Nebius, a cloud company that actually makes something. Not an app. Not a token. Not a walled garden for depressed influencers. But proper infrastructure. Big, humming, power-hungry, Nvidia GPU-chomping cloud infrastructure. It doesn’t rent servers. It builds data centres, the actual GPU data centres. The racks. The cooling. The power. The firmware. All tuned to the only thing that matters in AI performance at scale, it does this in Finland, Iceland & America. With its own cooling systems, its own racks, its own power supply because clearly relying on PG&E or National Grid is the sort of decision made by people who think TikTok is a news service. It is rare, outside of Cupertino and Pyongyang, to see such vertical integration. Put another way, this is AWS with soul, this is the brains of Helsinki, the patience of Tel Aviv, and the power grid of a small Balkan republic, all stitched together under a founder who knows the stakes and is playing for a legacy. Unlike many of Silicon Valley’s delusional cap table hobbyists, Nebius makes money. Revenues are + 625%. Quarter-on-quarter! It just raised ARR guidance to over a $1billion. And it’s only just got started. Meanwhile, the palo Alto unicorns are choking on stock-based comp. There’s no debt. $1.4 billion in cash. Not a single customer big enough to hold them hostage. And they have a grip on their capex like a Yorkshireman with a £20 note. The real story is this: while the West is sleepwalking into an AI bottleneck, Nebius is quietly laying pipes, building racks, and preparing to sell compute to anyone desperate enough to need it, which is to say, everyone. Startups. Governments. Labs. TikTok’s moderators. You name it. In addition they’ve got a robotaxi company (Avride), a booming data labeller (Toloka), an EdTech rocketship (TripleTen), and a stake in ClickHouse. Finally, here’s the real rub it’s part of my “Portfolio for Peace”, in Ukraine story for good reason, because while Nebius was born from the ashes of Yandex and the bitter bifurcation of a nation, it now sits outside of that war, outside of that state, building the tools that might one day allow a different kind of power to flourish, one not built on oil or tanks or territorial grievance, but on compute, collaboration, and code. If war is fought with drones and data, then peace will be brokered with infrastructure. And Nebius may just be the one selling many of the servers when it comes.” ‎<This message was edited>
[08/08/2025, 13:34:36] Matt Jonns: Few thoughts 

	•	it’s getting easier and easier to spin up the kind of software we are used to seeing now that’s deffo fact 
	•	but customer expectations are shifting fast,, they don’t want dashboards/logins, I.e to have to do too much work they want stuff to just work in the background , co- pilots , assistants, chat bots etc 
	•	that still takes time and investment , loads of new tools will pop up but most will look/feel the same if they’re vibe-coded (at least in medium term) 
	•	the winners will nail distribution + get deep into people’s existing workflows
	•	now’s a great time to reimagine businesses with all this new tech
	•	agree traditional tech moats are disappearing. Actually incumbents have an advantage if move fast - brand, network, data, and the hard offline stuff become the moat again (curation s great example !)
	•	lovable HAD to raise so much because it’s a race… but feels like the core LLMs will do what they do at scale soon. So many biz models  disappear when the core LLM’s bring out a feature that wipes them out overnight 
	•	niche use cases are safer, but coding is such a big prize they’ll 100% go after it. 

Side  point I find it v interesting meta was the LLMs to be commoditised as they want to build on top whereas Opem AI want the LLM’s to be THE technology where the £ is made.
[08/08/2025, 13:39:10] ~ Jason M: Totally agree. Software was an arbitrage between developers costs and what you could sell to a client at. Clients will now build most software tailored for themselves unless the price drops substantially. The whole space is a massive short.
[08/08/2025, 13:51:43] Matt Jonns: Agree the theory of that makes sense but dunno if will end up being the reality. Most internal digital / dev projects go wrong and it’s never been about the complexity of the tech it’s the culture of building , red tape or just not being a tech company  so not knowing how to do it. Enterprise SaaS will have to adapt tho for sure

1. Lab Coat Heart death play Cardiol / CRDL absurdly down 30% WTD on data that when seen fully will make this a great opportunity.

2. Nicely offset by +58% WTD in BMNR our ETHE custody play. 
Why?! Well, Ethereum is finally back through $4000!  It needs to now take out its 2022 highs! 
Many ask WHY ETHEREUM.
ETHE is the digital scaffolding holding up this absurd parallel economy of made-up money, and 22-year-olds pretending to be hedge fund managers from their mother’s conservatories oh and Free Mobiles!  Whilst Bitcoin is the cult, the messiah coin. Ethereum is the infrastructure, its the grease and the gears. It’s the seedy backroom of the internet where all the “decentralised” magic happens. Gambling, lending, borrowing, pumping, dumping. Ethereum doesn’t judge. It just processes. Is it essential? Yes. Without Ethereum, the whole shimmering illusion of Web3 collapses into a sad Discord server and a folder of unpaid JPEGs. Ethereum is the glue holding together the most interesting experiment the tech world’s managed to put together in a decade, or maybe ever! 

BMNR remains the best proxy.

[09/08/2025, 18:33:21] ~ Rich McDonald: Palantir upped sales guidance for 2025 by $200m this week….
And added $50bln to market cap. 👀 

Nvidia peak P/S ratio was 36x. Cisco peak P/S ratio was 39x

Palantir (130x) doesn’t drop to 36x until 2030 even with 35% compound sales growth. 

The stock could still trade at this level in 5 years, and be considered expensive.
I think this could be a patient / disciplined best shorting opportunity of any stock for a long time.

[10/08/2025, 15:15:39] ~ Katie Jackson: _While it is unclear what its UK proposition would be, job adverts have suggested the company will apply the same virtual power plant idea, in which a network of home batteries balances out inconsistent energy sources such as wind and solar, storing energy when it is abundant and putting it back into the grid at times of peak demand._

_Tesla launched an energy plan with Octopus Energy in 2020 but ended the partnership three years later as it stepped up its own plans. The company has since worked with Octopus to allow Powerwall owners to use the energy provider’s software to sell electricity at peak times._

_Tesla has not applied for a gas supply licence, meaning households that use electricity and gas – the vast majority in the UK – would have to choose a different gas supplier._

[12/08/2025, 09:07:49] ~ William Nutting: Its August and apart from Conor few have that much new  to talk about…

NF I know corraled Ben Ainslie into this group and there IS big news out on the future of the Americas Cup. Huge congrats Ben.
Nutstuff was sitting in the sun thinking about this,  so…

Nutstuff on the Americas Cup: 

“So, the America’s Cup, a travelling court of the wealthy and weathered and sailing’s longest-running excuse for very rich men to dress like sailors and shout at each other from carbon-fibre spaceships has finally decided to “modernise”.
Which in this case means letting everyone have a say, scheduling it every two years, and sticking an Instagram influencer on board during the race. Because nothing says “pinnacle of human engineering” quite like having a lifestyle blogger shrieking into their phone while you tack into a headwind. They’ve thrown in a few nods to inclusivity a token woman on board, youth events, and a nationality rule to make sure at least some of the crew know which country they’re allegedly representing. And there’s a cost cap, wow rationing billionaires is a novel concept, which will no doubt keep this famously frugal sport from getting too flashy. All of this is billed as the “boldest change in 174 years” which is a posh way of saying they’ve finally worked out the old system was confusing, self-serving, and impossible to sell to anyone who doesn’t own a vineyard. Now it’s a “shared vision” translation: an elaborate agreement to make sure the billionaires keep racing against each other in exactly the same boats, but with better sponsorship deals. Bring on Naples 2027, where the champagne will be cold, the sun will be hot, and the yachts will be worth more than the host city’s annual GDP. For the UK, the man behind Athena Racing isn’t a faceless corporate committee it’s Sir Ben Ainslie himself (or is it?!) Ben is the most decorated Olympic sailor Britain has ever produced and now wears at least four hats: Owner, Team Principal, CEO, and Skipper all rolled into one carbon-fibre package. The “Athena” name makes it sound like some sleek, well-funded syndicate, but really it’s Ben and whoever’s rich enough or patriotic enough to sign up. Nutstuff thinks he knows a few! Athena Racing, under his leadership, has now become the Challenger of Record for the 38th America’s Cup, fully representing the Royal Yacht Squadron. It’s Ainslie’s team, his vision, and come hell or high water his run to Naples in 2027. But it’s not just about Ben, he it seems is also heading the Athena Pathway project, bringing in youth and women sailors, and reviving some semblance of hope and inclusion into the ancient sport. And where’s Grumpy Sir Jim Ratcliffe in all this? Not on deck, that’s for sure. After chucking a couple of hundred million at the last campaign, Britain’s richest petrochemical patriot has walked away. Why? Because the whole thing moved at the speed of a becalmed dinghy and he’s got other toys to play with. Negotiations with the new Challenger of Record went on so long that Ratcliffe’s Ineos Britannia simply packed up and left. Which, given his recent luck in sport, a Chelsea shareholding, Manchester United minority stake, cycling team that peaked a decade ago might be a mercy killing.” (Nutstuff August ‘25). ‎<This message was edited>

CCJ et al are being patient signing deals with utilities unless it is on their terms.  Good chance we get some contracts signed with ceilings at $140 vs spot at $72.

Could be a good tactical entry point in uranium names ahead of this. LT story still very bullish as so little supply is coming.
[12/08/2025, 13:01:21] ~ William Nutting: CEO of LTBR coming too.
Remember Chris Wright was ln the board of OKLO. What seems clear is that this will accelerate the commercialisation of lightbridge fuel.
OKLO news 12th August This initiative will accelerate the commercialisation of advanced nuclear fuels and will include manufacturing Lightbridge fuel using repurposed plutonium from stockpiles of nuclear weapons, weapon cores and spent fuel from nuclear reactors.
[12/08/2025, 15:25:03] ~ William Nutting: 2 things…

1. LIGHTBRIDGE/ LTBR +25% 👏 +225% ytd so far..

2. WEED: VILLAGE FARMS TILRAY & GLASF.
Nutstuff has had the Marijuana / Cannabis call from the lows, it has needed patience and GLASF Glasshouse Farms has been THE play. Whats interesting is that many have “been to the party, thrown up in the pot plant, and sworn never again”. That’s why it’s interesting now. The hype’s gone, the stoners in Patagonia fleeces have been cleaned out, and the MSOS ETF looks like the sort of chart you get when you drop a trifle out of a tenth-floor window, Nutstuff loves. The same curmudgeons saying nay to digital assets are curled up on their sofas muttering about “false dawns” and “regulatory headwinds”, whilst the world outside is quietly changing. California is burning illegal mega-farms like it’s the DEA’s summer barbecue, which means less black-market product and more room for people who actually pay tax. Glass House and a few others are sitting there with half-empty greenhouses and balance sheets that don’t scream “money laundering front”. And then the rescheduling thing? If it happens, the move won’t be a polite, incremental re-rating. It’ll be an absolute face-melter, capital flooding back in, banking restrictions gone, institutional money buying anything with a leaf logo. If it doesn’t happen? The survivors still make a living because they’ve already adjusted to the trench warfare of over-taxed, over-regulated weed. To Nutstuff it’s the perfect contrarian set-up: everyone’s bored, nobody believes, and the upside is a once-a-decade legal high.

[13/08/2025, 14:02:45] Calum Curation: Marex Q2 2025 Earnings: 5 key points. 

1. Record Earnings and powerful growth:
Marex posted record results for Q2 2025, with adjusted profit before tax (PBT) of $106.4m, up 16% YoY, and revenue of $500.1m, up 18% YoY. For H1, adjusted PBT hit $202.7m (+27% YoY) on $967.4m revenue (+23% YoY). These results show strong momentum in both top-line and bottom-line growth. The uplift isn't a fluke; it comes off a tough comparator and demonstrates quality execution and strategic discipline.

2. Agency & Execution (Prime Services) transformation:
The Agency & Execution segment delivered explosive growth, with Q2 revenue jumping 59% YoY to $260.8m and adjusted PBT up 208% to $69m. Most importantly, Securities revenues (including Prime Services) soared 80% to $168.6m, highlighting the impact of integrating TD Cowen’s Prime Services business. Margin here expanded massively, and Prime Services is now a pillar of recurring, high-margin income—remarkable for a relatively new business line in the group.

3. Strategic M&A and Geographic/Product Expansion:
Marex continued executing on its M&A pipeline, closing deals (e.g., Agrinvest and Hamilton Court Group post-period) and announced the acquisition of Winterflood Securities in July 2025. These add exposure to South American agri markets, bolster FX capabilities in EMEA, and significantly enhance UK equity market making. The cumulative effect: powerful diversification, minimal capital outlay, and expanding franchise reach—all with clear, actionable integration stories.

4. Resilient risk management and liquidity:
Despite market volatility (notably the April US tariff shock), Marex maintained low credit losses and robust liquidity. Total liquid resources reached $3.4bn, with capital ratio at 242%—well above regulatory minimums, and surplus liquidity further strengthened by a $500m senior note issuance. That’s ballast for navigating unpredictable markets and staying investor-grade.

5. Shareholder Value with strong ROE and lower PE overhang:
Return on equity remains stellar at 28% for Q2, and adjusted ROE at 31.4%. Additionally, the private equity overhang continues to shrink, now just 17% of shares after major blocks sold in April and following months; a cleaner cap table is a positive for public investors. Marex also declared a $0.15/share quarterly dividend, underlining capital discipline and confidence in future cash flows.

Bottom Line:
Marex’s powerful and diversified profit growth, sharp execution on prime services, strategic deal activity, rock-solid risk management, and cap table cleanup together make this quarter compelling for professional investors. It’s a shifting story from transactional to platform-driven, recurring, and institutional—one where scale, integration, and capital management really matter.

See GLASSHOUSE FARMS/ GLASF! $500m mkt.
Honestly they just printed the sort of quarter that makes analysts (not many around anymore and they are all next to useless ) swoon, and competitors quietly sob into their dispensary jars. Revenue’s + 11% on last year and a thumping 34% on Q1, gross margins back over the magic 50% mark, and EBITDA has tripled since winter. They’ve cranked out nearly a quarter of a million pounds of weed, thats 54% more than last year and they chopped their production cost from $148 a pound to $91, which is like swapping your Bentley for a Tesla and finding out it actually makes you money.
Even the California retail market coughed up a 13% sales increase.Wholesale is roaring, cash flow has doubled, and they’re sitting on $44 million in the bank. In short: huge crop, lower costs, more cash, and a giant middle finger to everyone who said you can’t make money growing cannabis in California!

As Dr Windsor pointed out it has an ATM in operation. That’s why I think the stock kept pulling back . It’s not impossible that it’s now over . 

That might allow something stupid to happen . We shall see , bottom line is it’s at all time highs now. Z

[14/08/2025, 11:52:29] ~ William Nutting: A few thoughts on Bitcoin & Digital assets love the imagery of HELIUM and BULLISH! 

I guess it should be expected that Bitcoins dominance is sliding, which in crypto-speak means traders have decided they fancy a bit more sex and violence in their portfolios. 
Although many portfolios still have none and remind me of damp dark wet churches where it may be good to hide on roasting 40 Degree days but its all rather miserable and cool but not that COOL! 
Now Solana’s the current teacher’s pet, but even Helium that slightly baffling wireless thing ( with insanely +ve user data) and Dogecoin the internet’s favourite cartoon coin are picking up a tailwind. And then look who else is staggering back onto the pitch: Ethereum, still half the player it was in its glory days; then there’s Chainlink, criminally overlooked despite doing all the grunt work; Gala, the gaming token that’s been out in the cold for two years and Toncoin, riding a wave of Telegram-powered hype. All still miles off their all-time highs, but suddenly with a whiff of possibility about them. The lending markets are twitching back to life, liquidity’s on the turn, and Washington and Westminster are busy removing roadblocks for the very engines that drive these rallies. If history’s anything to go by, this is the bit where the forgotten coins start going on ridiculous runs and half of Twitter pretends they saw it coming. 
Oh and dont get me started on “BLSH / Bullish, the name alone is a naff wink to financial seriousness , its the City’s equivalent of a man in mirrored sunglasses telling you he’s in the know and aiming to be the BlackRock of Crypto, courting $100T of global AUM safely into digital assets.
With nearly $2B in BTC and a profitable core biz in trading (+78% yoy) and media (CoinDesk). Well as everyone is commenting it just pirouetted onto the NYSE yesterday, and has been rewarded with a 220% leap in value before the first glass of warm prosecco lost its fizz. $10bn dollars for a business that made $80 million last year and contrived to lose more than that in the first quarter. It is a delicious little irony. Crypto, the swaggering enfant terrible that swore to topple the banking citadel, has chosen instead to knock politely, hand its coat to JPMorgan, and float itself into the warm, chlorinated pool of Wall Street capital. Communists in pinstripes, raising money from the very thing they vowed to destroy.  There’s now $400 billion of these crypto-badged equities bobbing about in U.S. markets, exchanges, miners, the digital treasure chests of listed companies all tethered to assets with value only so long as another hand is willing to take them. Two years ago, in the black comedy of the FTX collapse, they were worth much less.  Seeing things like this has a few justified in asking whether blockchain will indeed become the great arterial system of global finance or maybe Bullish is just another golden helium balloon, drifting upwards on hot air, waiting for the pin.” ( Nutstuff). ‎<This message was edited>

[14/08/2025, 21:03:08] ~ William Nutting: Oh, here we go again the internet’s favourite miracle. The car that runs on water. This time it’s Toyota, allegedly, with some hydrogen-on-demand wizardry that turns a litre of Evian into 400 miles of guilt-free motoring. The video’s got that usual mix of techno-babble, stock footage, and blokes in lab coats nodding gravely. And yes of course, if it were true, it would change everything. Oil would be finished. Nuclear would be redundant. The Saudis would all have to go and get proper jobs. Greta could finally pack it in and do a cookery podcast.  But it’s not true. Because lets get scientifically real, water isn’t a fuel. You can’t run an engine on it without putting more energy in than you get out. That’s not me being cynical, that’s basic physics the same physics that means perpetual motion machines don’t work and unicorns don’t exist, and your mate Philips! crypto mining rig won’t make him a millionaire. If Toyota had actually built this thing, they wouldn’t be announcing it on some bloke’s Instagram reel. They’d be on the front page of every newspaper on earth. The truth is, this is just another round of the same old fairy tale half YouTube scam, half pub conspiracy and the only thing it’s running on is the gullibility of people who think “science” is “magic”.

2 days ago, Nutstuff Wednesday: ****UNH: I have just covered my short: United Healthcare/UNH US: Margin recovery could be huge in 2026 with the average ACA preliminary rate requesting a +20-30% increase! Cigna/ CI: currently asking for a 35% rate increase followed by $CNC at 27%, $UNH at 26% and $OSCR at 21%. I think the market could be underestimating earnings growth going into 2026 for a lot of these Healthcare names. Now UNH is down a long way and cash rich Buffett understands insurance as we know, maybe this is why these stocks have been rallying in the last few days.
[14/08/2025, 22:18:21] ~ Robin Maxwell: Evolv… just been on earnings call (when train WiFi allowed). Key points in no particular order 1) upgrading year end guidance to rev growth now 27-30% from 20-25%. 2) 2Q saw first ever increase in quarterly cash sequentially. 3) company changing sales model - bringing everything in house. Will impact GM -ve short term but +ve impact on 2026 ARR 4) Mike - a founder - is stepping down to pursue another project outside security industry 5) seeing increasing momentum in clients upgrading to Gen 2 and signing new 4 year deals. 6) announced new $15m order from a hospital group I think (will have both express and expedite… quite poss I have that slightly wrong). 7) prob old news as CEO confirms that all litigation/ investigations into co are now done / stopped. Max corp liability $1m. Nothing from CEO on progress ex USA … all about US from him. Have not listened to Q&A … market should like much of this but NF can put in more context - especially Founder departure.

[15/08/2025, 00:31:27] ~ Raj Shah: EVLV: Fantastic Q raising guidance even above the high end of the prior range. Sales motion is working very well. eXpedite AI bag scanner is selling like gangbusters. Some massive deals coming in 2H. This is still a conservative new guide.

Biggest incremental change is taking back hardware sales to do direct vs. via Columbia Tech (only for customers who want to own hardware). And yes while it impacts gross margin negatively in the near term they are maximizing profit. And the right time to do that is when you’re rapidly growing FCF and EBITDA.

Keep in mind *the north star here is AXON* which has been one of the best performing stocks period, not just in this industry. AXON has had 60% gross margins forever - all leverage has come below gross profit.

[15/08/2025, 12:08:00] Nick finegold: Pioneer Power Solutions +60% pre open 

For those tracking Pioneer Power Solutions, the micro cap company delivered earnings in line with the guidance they’ve maintained all year.

Pioneer provides mobile power generation to grid gaps , is aligned somewhat to the roll out of Av’s in time and particularly valuable in remote or underserved areas. 

One of the most intriguing future use cases: as Hyperscalers increasingly drain capacity from the grid, Pioneer’s upcoming e-mobility home generator (launching late 2025/early 2026) could give homeowners reliable independent, clean propane-powered generation.

The stock is indicated up ~60% pre-market. Still a micro-cap and not for everyone — but an interesting one to keep on the radar. I think other Achilles heel is a lack of ability to produce the products they’re selling in sufficient scale . 

For disclosure I have owned the stock for a year it’s been an awful performer and have no real intention of selling it or buying more just yet.

[15/08/2025, 14:00:23] ~ Ben Finegold: ASP Isotopes, Quantum Leap Energy and Fermi America Join Forces to Power the Future of U.S. Nuclear Fuel — Ocean Wall Advises on Landmark Deal
 

ASP Isotopes Inc (NASDAQ: ASPI) and subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Fermi America to develop a High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) enrichment facility at the planned 11GW HyperGrid Campus in Texas — set to be the world’s largest hybrid energy and data infrastructure site.

The state-of-the-art facility will produce advanced nuclear fuels for small modular reactors, alongside a separate ASP Isotopes-owned site manufacturing stable isotopes for high-growth sectors such as quantum computing, nuclear medicine and next-generation semiconductors.

Co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Fermi America will lead regulatory approvals, with the HyperGrid site offering unique proximity to the DOE’s Pantex Plant.

ASP Isotopes has received interest from potential customers who collectively require over $37 billion of HALEU between the present day and 2037, at current market prices.

Ocean Wall Limited acted as exclusive adviser to both ASP Isotopes and Fermi America, playing a critical role in securing this strategic partnership
[15/08/2025, 14:05:06] ~ William Nutting: Another great deal!
[15/08/2025, 14:08:57] ~ Ben Finegold: I am about to land back in London having spent 3 days in Dallas visiting Fermi America. Their data centre project is 2.5x the size of Stargate and will total 11GW - that is the same amount of power required by the entire state of Tennessee, or 3.5x the city of Dallas. It will include nuclear, gas, solar, battery back up.

Importantly, their neighbours are Pantex - one of the if not the most strategically important nuclear facility in the U.S. - it’s where the bunker bombs for the recent Iran bombings were built. This means expedited build times for nuclear, and public acceptance already baked in. We could not dream up a more perfect site for ASPI/QLE to commence their ground presence in the U.S. 

The Fermi team are very well connected, backed by Governor Rick Perry and ex CEO of Quantum Energy Partners Toby Neugebaur.

Realistic End-of-Year Range

Based on these collective forecasts and current market dynamics, a well-reasoned estimation for the PPSI stock price by year-end would be:

Base scenario: approximately $10.00–$11.00, reflecting consensus moderate upside (~140–160%)

Bullish scenario: up to $12.00, especially if momentum from Q2 results and EV charging demand continues

Downside risk: if execution falters or broader market volatility intensifies, the price might remain below $9.00

Summary Table
Scenario	Estimated Price	Rationale
Base (most likely)	$10.00–$11.00	Aligns with consensus targets and ongoing growth catalysts
Bullish	Up to $12.00	Drives from strong momentum, contracts, and execution in EV infrastructure
Bearish/Risk	Below $9.00	Possible if execution issues or macro headwinds emerge

Maybe subbing out manufacturing is a good way to go , but they have more than enough cash to build a new plant . ‎<This message was edited>
[16/08/2025, 09:49:19] ~ William Nutting: ANCHORAGE = IT SEEMS PROGRESS. 

“Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he will now travel to Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump to discuss the end of Russia's invasion. “

My precursor to Trump meeting Putin in Alaska was: 
The West went all out to destroy Russia and it didn’t collapse because their strategy was wrong and their narrative was wrong etc Russia now has a huge war conditioned army and the West is in trouble with no Ammo, no men and less and less money. The USA now has different interests in a new world and Europe is not so important. Eurasia with 5 billion people plus is! So you have two simple options, destroy Russia or work with Russia. 

I THINK THIS MORE THAN HELD UP! 
To Nutstuff it is inconceivable that any other US president would have welcomed the Russian with such theatrical warmth. Biden would have wheezed out a rebuke from Delaware; Obama would have made a speech about values. Trump pours the vodka and calls it progress. The Media, Ukrainians and their cheerleaders are having collective aneurysms, but the truth is obvious: Russia’s had the upper hand for years. Five-to-one on manpower, seven-to-one on kit, and no amount of Western daydreaming about magic weapons changes that. Putin says he wants peace, Trump says “no deal yet but maybe next time in Moscow.” Which is Trump for: I’ll sell it to Zelensky when I can. No ceasefire, no treaty, no champagne just the quiet acceptance that Ukraine can’t win a war of attrition and will eventually have to sign away land to stop the bleeding. The media are flapping as if it’s Munich all over again, but the only real takeaway is that both men came out smiling, neither gave an inch, and both know they’re not actually enemies. So, yes progress, if you can call it that, made over coffee in Anchorage.

[17/08/2025, 17:04:09] ~ Ben Finegold: Comment on ASP Isotopes from this weekend’s The Nuclear Review 

ASP Isoptopes 

Nuclear firms pledge 1,000 jobs at old reactor site. ASP Isotope’s QLE is partnering with a nuclear fusion company, Astral Systems, to utilize the decommissioned Berkeley nuclear power station in Gloucestershire. QLE says the plant could be commissioned two years after starting. The venture is still in the idea phase, with significant hurdles to overcome on the financial, regulatory, and civil works fronts.

ASP Isotopes enters into a MOU with Fermi America. A major announcement between the massive Fermi project in Texas and ASPI was announced just as we were writing the report. Some major takeaways from the press release:

“MOU contemplates the formation of a joint venture between QLE and Fermi America for the development of a HALEU enrichment research and commercial production facility (the “TX JV HALEU Project”)”

The significance here is ASPI has finally found a way into the domestic market to claim status as a US owned and operated uranium enrichment company:

“Fermi America is expected to be responsible for obtaining all licenses, permits, governmental and regulatory approvals, and other required consents for the JV HALEU Project”

“The property leased by Fermi America … is strategically located near the DOE-operated Pantex Plant … The site is pre-qualified for nuclear deployment under DOE and NRC precedent studies”

NR Comments: Entrance into the US market will enable ASPI/QLE to finally potentially compete with Centrus and General Matter. A very significant development for their spinoff of QLE, which is still targeted for Q4 this year.

PELOTON/ PTON US. The Market loves a come-back kid! Peloton’s chart looks like the ECG of a man already being embalmed, but October brings a chance of its improbable resurrection: “Peloton Intelligence”, an AI nanny that personalises, nags, translates and flatters in real time. The bikes and treadmills are now just props; the real play is the subscription, high-margin, low-churn, AWS-polished. What was once a lump of iron in your living room is trying to reappear as a concierge in your life. But here’s the thing, the corpse is twitching. They’ve stopped pretending to be a fancy bike shop for bored lawyers in Brooklyn and started acting like a subscription business. Proper sticky stuff too: AI trainers that nag you in real time, workout plans you don’t have to think about, multilingual subtitles so even the French can understand, and all of it stitched together with AWS so the back end doesn’t collapse every five minutes. Churn’s down to 1.2%, margins up at 69%. That’s software economics, not metal frame and plastic pedal economics. They’re flogging refurbished gear now, with self-assembly, so you don’t need a delivery crew in Lycra charging you £200 to screw in a bolt. The bet? They can relaunch in October with their so-called “Peloton Intelligence” and stop being the punchline of lockdown stocks. If it works, they’re not a bike company anymore they’re a sticky AI fitness cult and that =re-rating. ‎<This message was edited>

[18/08/2025, 11:04:16] ~ Philip Donald: More evidence that ‘ security ‘ is a one way bet.  Tech execs beefed up their security in a big way last year. According to the Financial Times, 10 major tech companies spent more than $45 million combined to protect their CEOs in 2024. The amount was at least 10% higher than in 2023. The FT quoted a security company founder, who said, “People are fixating on the leader of a company as the representation of all that is wrong with the world.”

About 60% of the 2024 total was spent on just one executive and his family: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose protection budget topped $27 million. Some of Zuck’s concerns seem kind of specific. According to Fortune, his polarizing AI projects, his aggressive poaching of employees from other tech firms, and his angry neighbors in Hawaii all add to security concerns.

Clarification around Q2 miss. Two clients wanted specification changes to end products which caused the push
of revenue recognition to Q3. Does not change FY numbers. Company long term targets are 25% annual revenue growth . Gross margin and operating margins all trending higher given new orders are higher value add and larger, given shift to more integral higher tech systems. Operating leverage also kicking in. Earnings growth will comfortably outpace revenue growth. Dont give away much in guidance but FY numbers look  firm given order delivery in H2 . Stock is trading on 25x FY 26 and 16 x FY 27.  (SEB numbers most realistic) Interestingly MilDef said that 50% of current sales are heading to Ukraine and the planned rebuild of European defence hasnt even started yet. Guess there's a risk in transition here if peace comes to Ukraine. As European defence spending ramps up I think MilDef becomes a multi year growth story of 20% + earnings growth.

[18/08/2025, 20:22:38] ~ Ben Finegold: In a year when many clean energy subsidies are being cut or redirected, geothermal has emerged as a rare bipartisan winner. President Donald Trump’s sweeping “One Big Beautiful Bill” gutted or sharply reduced incentives for solar and wind, but it kept the federal Investment Tax Credit for commercial geothermal projects until the mid-2030s. All the others expire at the end of this year.

Geothermal’s strong connection to oil and gas drilling technology gives it political support across party lines, especially among lawmakers worried about energy reliability and jobs in traditional industries.

[19/08/2025, 09:40:15] ~ Katie Jackson: 📈 *Buy Pitch (Bull case)*
*Intel (INTC US) – Strategic BUY*
Intel is being positioned as a national champion. The Trump administration is said to be considering a 10% stake, while SoftBank is investing $2bn at $23/share (stock +5% AH to $25). This is stake-building from both Washington and Masayoshi Son – a signal that Intel is too strategic to fail in the AI + semiconductor race. Technicals reinforce the story: consolidating above the 200-day EMA with golden crosses set to trigger. With government and SoftBank capital providing a backstop, reiterate BUY.

⸻

📉 *Sell Pitch (Bear case)*
*Intel (INTC US) – Sell the Dream*
SoftBank’s $2bn investment and potential US government stake only buy Intel time – they don’t fix the core problem: strategic paralysis. Intel lost its nerve under Gelsinger, abandoned catch-up investment with TSMC, and has no clear breakup plan under new CEO Tan. Meanwhile, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are steadily eating Intel’s market share in PCs and data centres. Customers are losing confidence, competition is accelerating, and execution remains absent. Money alone won’t solve Intel’s strategic quagmire. No price looks compelling – avoid/sell. ‎<This message was edited>

Softbanks $2bn. Means very little as does cash from the US Government in the short term . Intel has a $10bn + stake  in Mobileye it could sell down if they needed to raise cash badly . . 

The big question is what comes after the cash ? In the case of MP it was an off take agreement with Apple , but I am not sure what follows the cash investment in the case of Intel  as it’s being  it’s  a technological laggard that is the issue . Taiwan Semi has already committed to building in the US . So it’s a little less clear to me how you turn Intel even with the cash injection . I think that’s Richard’s point , Wills is simply that SoftBank and the US government being on side will do the shares no harm at all . I personally will not be getting involved .

[20/08/2025, 09:43:05] ~ William Nutting: SEMIS & CHINA (buy!) so Trumps White House is now floating the idea of buying into the very chipmakers it’s supposed to be regulating: Intel, Micron, Samsung, even TSMC. A kind of nationalisation-lite dressed up as “strategic investment.” The same crowd that can’t run Amtrak without spilling coffee down their tie now want to sit on the boards of the most important companies in the world. What could possibly go wrong?  Which is why Lutnick’s warning — “get away from TSMC” lands with such force. Washington doesn’t want its critical silicon printed in Taipei, a missile’s throw from the PLA. They want it inside the perimeter, subsidised, propped up and, increasingly, part-owned. Intel becomes the chosen child, TSMC the problem child. Hence the logical pair trade: long INTC, short TSM.  And yes, the crypto market called this whole charade years ago. The asset class was the tell: liquidity sloshing around, governments desperate for control, and the dawning realisation that “strategic” really means “ours, not theirs.” Meanwhile in Beijing, the firehose of fiscal stimulus still can’t lift them out of a deflationary undertow. Which means more is coming a lot more. That’s the other big buy theme: China!!!
The message from all sides is the same: Washington wants the fabs inside the wire, Beijing wants the liquidity inside the system, and everyone else can frankly go whistle!

[21/08/2025, 09:49:36] ~ William Nutting: To this end …

Nutstuff loves all these rapidly emerging AI doom mongers..

Their case is essentially : 

AI: Another bubble, another load of wide-eyed mugs convinced they’re buying into the future, when really they’re just funding the most expensive bonfire since WeWork. $400bn billion on data centres this year sheds stuffed with GPUs that’ll be obsolete before your laptop battery dies. And what do they make? $15bn in revenue. That’s it. A kebab shop in Croydon makes better margins. £40bn in depreciation before you’ve even sold a licence. Negative 1900% gross margin. They’re literally giving the stuff away  “have some AI with your latte, sir.” It’s lunacy on stilts. But don’t worry, the tech pm’s analysts tell us, once revenues grow 10X everything will be fine. Sure. And I’ll be dating Margot Robbie by Christmas. We’ve seen it all before: Global Crossing sank billions into fibre (they used a lot of debt!), shale drillers set fire to cash, cannabis farmers filled warehouses with weed nobody wanted. Now the MAG7 are doing the same. It’s FOMO as a business model. And where does it end? With these “magnificent” tech stocks valued like grubby shale firms, 3X cashflow, if they’re lucky. Investors who cheered it on will suddenly discover they’ve “bought a pup”. The guillotine falls, management gets the sack, shareholders get shafted. Same script, bigger numbers, same idiots funding it.  AI? It’s not intelligence, artificial or otherwise. It’s just another bubble, and the only thing it’s really done is fed greed & disrupted common sense. 

Nutstuffs response is…

$400bn flung at humming sheds of silicon & $15bn trickling back, negative margins that would shame that kebab van at closing time. To the cautious eye, it’s lunacy a bonfire of capital, déjà vu from fibre, shale, cannabis (lots of alpha YTD for yours truly!) But here’s the thing: lunacy built the world you live in. FCF has funded it not the $12bn of debt Global crossing accumulated. The bankrupt dot-coms laid the cables your phone still feeds on. The “loss-making” cloud turned into a $100bn utility. Smartphones, derided as toys, reshaped civilisation. Every revolution arrives disguised as financial suicide. Yes, the maths looks grotesque now $40bn in depreciation against $15bn of sales. But depreciation is the down payment on empire. The companies writing these cheques aren’t start-up chancers, they’re trillion-dollar leviathans who can afford to lose more money in a quarter than most nations collect in tax. And the governments themselves terrified of being second-tier in the AI arms race will shovel cash in too. So, sneer if you like. Call it a bubble, and you’ll maybe be right, in the short term. The guillotine will fall on plenty of investors. But the survivors will own the rails of the next thirty years (Nutstuff argues for Blockchain rails and the New Protocols, the “Block 7”) finance, compute, telecom, infrastructure which means a chance less rent paid to the older world leviathans but still a lot. AI isn’t just burning cash. It’s setting fire to the old order. And when the smoke clears, you’ll realise the only thing more absurd than spending $400bn now was not spending it at all. 

BUT I’d also add: The is/was one of the greatest market pi**-ups in market history $9.6 trillion in four months, all on the back of a few AI fairytales and Nvidia’s wet dream of infinite growth and most of the City and Wall Street missed it. They sat there, sober, muttering about valuations while the nerds in pyjamas were mainlining call options. Now the charts have cracked, and suddenly every sour-faced fund manager who didn’t get an invite to the orgy is desperate to call last orders. Not because the technology’s dead, or because Nvidia suddenly forgot how to print chips but because they can’t stand the thought of anyone else having made money while they sat it out. That’s the market now: not bulls versus bears, but the hangover brigade cheering for everyone to throw up. Every dip will be celebrated like England winning a penalty shoot-out. Every dead-cat bounce will be sneered at as “froth”.
It isn’t game over for AI. It’s game over for the mania. And the people most invested in killing it are the ones who never owned a damned share!
[21/08/2025, 09:51:56] ~ Jim: I agree with Kuppy on this  = the railways never made money ...this is a colossal misallocation of capital
[21/08/2025, 10:16:25] ~ Robin Maxwell: Reminds me of Tony Dye PDFM 1998… no value on offer - but the party went on another two years. At same time a new co called Amazon.com presented at a Dresdner Kleinwort offsite to an audience suffering a drink induced hangover ! Buy books online ? £1000 pounds invested then and we’d be in St Bart’s forever… point is it was so much more than books in the end but we just couldn’t see it at the time. Bubble has to burst first but you def buy the burst … and all the survivors share prices are well well above their 2000 highs. All comes down to time horizons ultimately. Worry for me shorter term is that much of the money running this AI party is fast and impatient and cares little for fundamental thinking until the burst and then value suddenly becomes important again. Witness Novo amongst many others. ‎<This message was edited>

[21/08/2025, 16:02:32] Matt Jonns: I read a wonderful piece on this a couple of years ago that articulated it much better than I ever could ! 

https://www.generalist.com/p/productive-bubbles

If not a subscriber quick summary below…

There are different kinds of bubbles:
	•	Some bubbles destroy value (e.g. tulip mania…lots of hype, nothing lasting..)
	•	Some bubbles actually create value, even if investors lose money (e.g. the railway boom ,, many investors went bust, but the rail network laid the foundation for decades of growth).
	•	AI feels more like a “railway bubble”…insane amounts of capital will be (is ! Now we are 2 years later it’s being proven to be true ) deployed, many players won’t survive, but the infrastructure built (models, compute, tooling, talent base) will massively accelerate future innovation.

“Part of the reason even productive bubbles are wasteful is that it’s incredibly difficult to find “killer applications” for novel technology. For example, one early use case for the telephone was listening to music; meanwhile, radios only embraced broadcast after World War I. It may take decades for innovation to find its ideal implementation.”
[21/08/2025, 16:08:33] ~ William Nutting: Its all too easy to do the railways “misallocation of capital” argument all because investors lost money. There is so much more to this debate than that, Railways created modern life, cities, trade, time itself even ran on their timetables. Whether Victorian shareholders went bust is frankly trivia. Same with AI: it may be messy, overbuilt and badly valued, but it’s not optional. It’s the future turning up, whether you like the valuations or margins! ‎<This message was edited>

[22/08/2025, 06:56:49] Nick finegold: Zoom reported last night , modest single digit growth, but the best numbers in 11 quarters. PE 12x  which is an ex growth multiple. 

However, with almost $8bn of cash vs $21bn of market, $500m of free cash flow per quarter and buying back 5-6m shares a quarter, it now reminds me of eBay , or let’s call it Value tech ! EBay has gone up 30% post the numbers as the unloved tech companies of yesterday stage a quiet unnoticed comeback .

Financial’s 
	•	Cash and Liquidity:
Zoom ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. 
	•	Share Buyback:
Zoom has a $2.7 billion share buyback plan and accelerated execution in Q2 by purchasing 6 million shares for $463 million. This was an increase of approximately 389,000 shares purchased compared to the previous quarter. This buyback reflects Zoom’s commitment to returning value to shareholders.
	•	Q3 Revenue Guidance:
Zoom expects Q3 revenue between $1.21 billion and $1.215 billion, representing around 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
	•	Profitability Guidance:
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $465 million and $470 million, translating to an operating margin around 38.6% at the midpoint.
	•	Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance:
Non-GAAP EPS is anticipated in the range of $1.42 to $1.44 per share, based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. Note that this EPS guidance does not account for any future share repurchases.
Overall, Zoom is showing steady revenue growth, healthy operating margins, and is actively buying back shares to enhance shareholder value.

[22/08/2025, 07:11:25] ~ William Nutting: 🇨🇳 Chinaaaa. 

A stat! As of August 2025, the Magnificent 7 (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Broadcom, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA) have a combined market cap of $17 trillion. Major Chinese tech firms (e.g., Tencent, Alibaba, others) total ~$1.5-$2 trillion. Thats roughly 10-12% of the Mag7! 

China stocks are really moving again. Nutstuff is excited to be going to china again in late October with Louis Gave ( who really is an expert). Nutstuff owns lots of China and as you know it was added to in the last 6 weeks via HK real Estate. You buy China now because still few dare to and when I talk about an ongoing 1000 year Global GDP % “mean reversion” eyes just roll! The West’s fund managers are all terrified of Xi Jinping turning up at their AGM in a Mao suit and nationalising all their dividends. (So own HK lines!) Trump is banning Nvidia chips, Europe is banning Huawei kettles, and everyone is pretending they don’t secretly quite like TikTok. 

Meanwhile…

On ETF’s: 

FXI US is the big, ugly basket of state-favoured dinosaurs, banks, oil companies, telecoms which Beijing props up because they know where the skeletons are buried. Has doubled in 24mths. 

KWEB is the fun one: Alibaba, Tencent, JD, Meituan. The clever internet lads who got hammered when Xi decided online tutoring was a bigger threat than the US Navy! All when at the same time as the Mag7 AI ORGY participants trade at 30x sales; their chinese cousins are limping along at “please just shoot me” valuations. Yes. China looks scary. That’s why it’s cheap.

🎩 to Conor Smith too for his relentless call here. His PRU LN call is bang on.

[22/08/2025, 07:32:08] ~ Robin Maxwell: IonQ are buying Oxford Ionics. Why? Because Oxford have developed the tech to produce fastest Quantum compute. Now being deployed for first time ‘in the field’ ie outside the lab. But key for me is Oxford CEO Chris Balance. First saw him present at Lansdowne Partners investor day in June (OI has been one of Peter Davies 8 UK scale up bets) - Chris has that ability to tell the Quantum story in soundbites understandable to the retail / Reddit crowd. Eg learned this morning JP Morgan have 100 PHD’s working on Quantum algorithms as part of CEO assertion that Financial services are a key end market. If you ever learned a language, learning Quantum is tricky, Chris Balance makes it more accessible and understandable- perceived risk falls.

[22/08/2025, 07:42:28] ~ Ben Finegold: Writing up our thoughts on this. The world’s largest producer responsible for >40% of global uranium supply has said its production capabilities are 10% lower than previously announced, removing ~5% of global supply from the market. In addition to this, Kazatomprom are able to exercise an option to produce 20% below this production capability, which they said they intend to exercise given they ‘value over volume’ approach. This is essentially Kazatomprom recognising - finally - their pricing power in uranium and will force utilities into the term market to contract. View this release as very smart, very positive for uranium names ahead of WNA in London first week of September.

[22/08/2025, 10:05:03] ~ Julius: If I want to a London listed uranium holding company that provides exposure to the metal, those are necessary fees. If management can add value (NAV/share) via location swaps/buy backs that’s great. But they don’t need to erode 1-2% a year to pay for equity raises done at a discount to NAV as charity to the rest of the sector. That’s why they trade at such a steep discount.

SOHO-HOUSE: I am amused to see all the celebrity and media spin on this Apollo buy-out. Nick Finegold persuaded me a few years back to speak to management and look at this, and I came away being super impressed with what Nick Jones had built but resoundingly negative on what I saw happening as Ron Burkle got involved. In 28 years, Soho House has never been profitable under GAAP. Ever. Apollo throwing $850m of their own or others money into Soho House is the financial equivalent of sticking your todger in a blender and hoping it’ll make you a smoothie. The place has never made a profit in 30 years, unless you count the bar staff pocketing the service charge. The whole “exclusive club” aura feels a bit “shot”, there are more members than there are chairs. You’re paying thousands a year for the privilege of queuing for a flat white next to three influencers, a property developer, and a man in white trainers who looks like he’s just been turned down for Love Island. The books? A dog’s breakfast. Fanciful EBITDA, 100-year depreciation schedules, cash flow so bad it makes WeWork look like …Every trick in the accountant’s manual short of claiming the Martini glasses as assets. Apollo aren’t buying a business, they’re propping up a lifestyle hospice. It’s not “investment”, it’s charity for the terminally pretentious. And in a few years’ time, when the debt crushes it, Soho House will likely go the way of WeWork with better cocktails. Or some one,  make me a member and show & tell me why I am wrong!

[24/08/2025, 19:40:41] ~ William Nutting: NF like your QCOM reminder. 
Own..
So..

QCOM: so the market has gone full “Bacchanal” ( you should have studied harder in latin!) on AI NVIDIA at $4 trillion, AMD and Broadcom priced like they’re curing cancer all the while poor old Qualcomm, the company that actually puts the silicon in your pocket, sits sulking in the corner at 13x. It’s the cheapest large-cap tech stock because the Street still thinks of it as “that Apple modem supplier.” As if a firm with $9 billion in annual free cash flow, 100% of it returned to shareholders, and the chip architecture that runs AI on your phone, glasses, and dashboard is just an afterthought. Nutstuff remembers taking Irwin Jacobs around Europe twenty-odd years ago. He knew exactly how to tell the story: Qualcomm makes the wireless brain that everything else plugs into. That hasn’t changed only now it’s AI, not CDMA. The great AI orgy of 2025 has everyone queuing up to spray money at data centres, but the hangover is coming. Hyperscaler capex will turn into a bonfire of write-downs, and the only AI names left standing will be the ones selling the actual shovels. Qualcomm sells the shovels that go in your pocket,on your face, and into your car.  Phones are becoming inference engines, smart glasses are quietly exploding (Meta Ray-Bans +200%, I addicted to mine!), and every car dashboard refresh is more silicon sold. Meanwhile Qualcomm buys back 1:10 shares and pays you to wait.  
Many ask: Why so cheap? My sense is its simple because the market’s drunk, high, and tediously hanging off Jensen Huang’s every leather cladded word, lets wait until Wednesday! But when the come-down hits, Qualcomm will still be compounding, quietly, boringly, at 15x!

The Company is currently achieving an enrichment factor of 52, which is in line with Company’s expectations of greater than 50. The Company expects the production of Ytterbium-176 to be a two-step process with the first batch enriching product from natural abundance of 13% Ytterbium-176 to at least 88% and the final batch completing the enrichment from 88% to 99.75%.

Demand for Carbon-12 significantly exceeds the demand for Carbon-14 and the Company is assessing the potential to expand the capacity of the Carbon enrichment facility to be able to supply both Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 from this facility."
[26/08/2025, 08:47:56] ~ William Nutting: So Trump’s now basically running the Fed. Cook’s out, Powell’s irrelevant writing his memoirs now no doubt and independence at the world’s most important central bank has gone the way of British Leyland. The President controls four out of seven governors — which means he sets rates, prints money, and tells Wall Street when to jump. Powell’s still there, technically, but about as much use as a chocolate teapot. Rates? Markets still think the “terminal” is 3%. Try at least a point lower. Liquidity will gush like a busted fire hydrant, the dollar will slide, and risk assets will roar. Welcome back to QE-land. In Britain, Reeves and Starmer are heading for their own Greek tragedy: promises on tax they can’t keep, spending they can’t cut, and a party that may knife its own PM when the budget implodes. Watch the 30-year gilt yield ( same en France!) it’s telling you the whole circus is about to wobble. So what’s the trade? Well Ignore the official script. 
Trump’s Fed means negative real yields and another crack-up boom in financial assets stocks, crypto, tat. 
China, few own and working. 
Energy, Oil kept cheap on purpose. Good for Trump’s numbers, crap for renewables. Fossil Fuel capex still dead. (until it isnt; start to think about Stable Coins/tokenisation)?Trade is short Ørsted ( said for mths and said no way to play 2 weeks ago!) maybe against it Long Exxon, and for now forget saving the planet. 
Overall: The whole Trump 2.0 show works only if the dollar stays weak and oil stays cheap. Bet against either of those and the wheels come off. In the meantime? Buy Italian bonds, trade EM debt, stay wary of Japan, and don’t go anywhere near French OATs unless you enjoy pain.
UK here too is heading for a gilt crisis. My hedges to this is North Sea spec-sits and 2x left for dead UK housing / capex food chain co’s. 
So, Strap in for the ride, Trump in the driver’s seat his grab bag next door to him is full of digital assets and Powell is tied up in the boot. ‎<This message was edited>

[26/08/2025, 11:25:44] Nick finegold: Is there any point at which you think it is possible we might get a financial forecast out of Aspi for the isotope side of the business , or does the current enrichment programme more time to run before they feel confident in producing numbers ? 

My guess is that the market will begin to focus on QLE spinoff and that will absorb them for a period of time , but getting clarity on the economics of the isotopes business ex QLE is very important and some stage . ‎<This message was edited>

David Guetta: wrote..”TITANIUM”..

Here’s a rewrite as URANIUM! 

“You shoot your words like bullets, But I’m the core that burns, Splitting atoms for power, Fuel the world in turns. I am uranium, glowing in the night,  Harness the fire, a nuclear light. Strong as the element driving the flame, Call me uranium remember the name.”

From mondays Nutstuff:
“ Team Trump in Washington is rediscovering the joy of building things: nuclear plants, data centres, solar farms, roads, bridges. Full-expensing turns the S&P into a capex carnival. Commodities copper, uranium, tungsten, all the ugly metals are suddenly sexy again because without them your AI toaster and your virtue-signalling wind farm don’t work.”
[27/08/2025, 09:20:23] Calum Curation: We onboarded Focus Graphite as a Curation Connect client last month and since then the shares are up 200%+. Focus is a micro-cap graphite developer with two high-purity assets in Quebec, including Lac Knife, one of the only North American graphite projects to hit 5N (99.9992%) purity, suitable for nuclear, battery, and aerospace applications.

Yesterday, it announced a major milestone; its graphite was successfully used in a hypersonic rocket launch with Pluto Aerospace, its first real-world aerospace validation and a meaningful step into North American defence and strategic supply chains.

Despite the shares tripling since joining Connect the risk/reward is still fascinating with lots of catalysts to come. We will host a call with the CEO as and when there is enough interest on here.

[27/08/2025, 09:40:39] Nick finegold: Summarised version of Adam’s new note on humanoid robots . At scale in the west Tesla remains their top pick . The rare earths and magnets needed to make them work come a close second. 

Humanoid Horizons: Beijing’s Robot Games & $5k Androids

Tesla (TSLA) remains analyst top pick with a $410 PT, as humanoid robotics hit a new inflection.

🏟 Beijing’s Big Show
	•	The World Robot Conference (WRC) and the first-ever World Humanoid Robot Games (WHRG) ran just days apart.
	•	200 robotics firms showcased advances; 500+ humanoids competed in athletic and scenario events.
	•	Viral highlights: robots falling, colliding, and malfunctioning — but progress mirrors the early days of AVs.
	•	Key takeaway: China has made humanoids a national priority, using the same playbook that vaulted it into EVs, batteries, drones, and solar dominance.

💡 The $5k Breakthrough
	•	Chinese startups (Unitree, EngineAI) unveiled humanoids priced around $5–6k, opening the door to mass adoption.
	•	The Unitree R1 and EngineAI SA02 aren’t the most advanced, but they’re cheap, mass-produced, and critical for gathering training data.
	•	For context: the Unitree G1 ($16k) is already widely deployed — even by US universities for AI research.

🇨🇳 vs 🇺🇸: Sentiment Gap
	•	Morgan Stanley survey (2k US & China respondents):
	•	US: Net positive 34–32% on humanoid use cases and 5-year adoption.
	•	China: Net positive 67–66%, roughly double the US.
	•	On “positive impact on society”: US just +5%, China a whopping +61%.
	•	Interpretation: state support + media coverage drive Chinese optimism; Western sentiment remains skeptical.

📈 Market Performance
	•	Humanoid 100 Index: +18% since Feb, outpacing S&P 500 and Europe, trailing only MSCI China & Korea.
	•	China Humanoid Value Chain: +16.3% MTD, driven by body (+17.6%), integrators (+15.1%), and brain (+8.1%) plays.
	•	Top performers: Lynas Rare Earths, Northern Rare Earths, Teradyne, Tuopu.

⚔️ The Bigger Battle
	•	Beyond hardware, the “robot race” is a fight for human talent and creativity.
	•	China is cultivating a cultural embrace of robotics across generations, while US policy lags in both support and education.

⸻

👉 Bottom line: $5k humanoids mark the Model T moment for robotics, and China is steering the race.
[27/08/2025, 09:41:48] Nick finegold: I wonder if humanoid robots require silver in any way ?
[27/08/2025, 09:45:20] ~ Robin Maxwell: Chat GPT response : So, unless specifically engineered with silver-based batteries, a humanoid robot would likely contain well under 0.5% of its total mass in silver — more likely in the tens of grams range.
[27/08/2025, 10:05:36] ~ Matt H: Let’s see if they can actually build nuclear powers stations. It’s all good talking about building them until you start construction and realise that it cost double what you thought. It’s a terrible waste of money. If you want to be competitive with China and India you have you use coal and gas to a lesser extent. 
Nuclear is the most expensive form of power. Logically it is stupid.
[27/08/2025, 10:08:56] ~ Robin Maxwell: As a member of Aldeburgh GC, I empathise with this view, watching the v early construction phase of Sizewell C ...this has got budget horror and local infrastructure chaos written all over it.
[27/08/2025, 10:10:58] Nick finegold: Everyone should watch inside Bill Gates brain on Netflix . Nuclear can work but only at massive scale which is why he sort to build his first SMR in China which funnily enough was vetoed by the first Trump administration. He chose China because to make nuclear work you need to 50+ reactors and only China at the time had the ambition to scale nuclear . You need common parts designs, skilled labour and manufacturing at scale . America has none of this currently . Terra power started this ambition on 2008 , they are miles ahead of anyone , which is what makes Aspi so damn interesting ( ie having terra power in their corner ) ‎<This message was edited>

[27/08/2025, 10:25:01] ~ William Nutting: Caveat bears: 🐻 Uranium/ Nuclear week is next week in London.. 

“Nuclear is too expensive, we’ll never build them, it’s all a waste.” Gosh, Funny how the French built a whole fleet of the bloody things in the 1970s and have had cheap, low-carbon electricity ever since, while we sit here burning Russian gas and moaning about the bills. Yes, nuclear projects go over budget because politicians meddle, contractors drag their heels, and every protest group demands gold-plated safety checks no one else in the world bothers with. China and India don’t whinge, they just get on and build. And here’s the thing: once you’ve got a nuclear plant running, it churns out power 24/7 for half a century. Try getting that from a solar farm in Lancashire.  As for “most expensive form of power” thats Daily Mail rot. Expensive compared to what? Importing LNG at eye-watering prices every winter? Subsidising wind when the air doesn’t blow? Nuclear is costly upfront, but over its life it’s cheaper than coal, cleaner than gas, and a damn sight more reliable than the fantasy of batteries saving us all. Logically stupid? No logically essential. The only thing more daft is believing Britain can compete with China on coal while pretending to care about emissions. Nuclear is the only grown-up option.
On SMR’s, you don’t Shoot shorts in the face you shoot em in the back of the head! Dont short $35bn fairy tales. Not when the storytellers ( not us!) are at their peak, selling visions of clean power and geopolitical independence to every punter with a Robinhood account. NF is right, the time to short these stocks will come when reality collides with physics, and the first “modular” project is a decade late and billions over budget.
[27/08/2025, 10:27:38] ~ Matt H: Have to disagree with you there Will.
[27/08/2025, 10:29:29] Nick finegold: I don’t think Terra Powers will be late or over budget but they have been at this for almost 20 years . The others I agree 100% with but my guess is their plan is to sell know how but not actually be on the hook for the build .  Try and find a contractor who wants to give you a fixed price with penalty clause in building an smr ! 


It’s an interesting debate . Anyway my main take from today is buy silver and not to worry about nuclear too much.
[27/08/2025, 10:29:40] ~ Matt H: What is nuclear trying to achieve? Energy security ? Green power ? What’s the point in green power when China has 3300 coal fired power stations and is building 400 more
[27/08/2025, 10:30:32] Nick finegold: I think that’s right as well but they are two different subjects .
[27/08/2025, 10:31:01] Nick finegold: What’s the point ?  is a different subject to will it happen and be profitable .
[27/08/2025, 10:42:50] ~ William Nutting: Ok my last on this for now but to paint colours to the mast again! 

Great question! 
What’s nuclear trying to achieve? One line: it’s about not being bent over by Russia every winter! 
In the West, Nuclear is dressed up as “green power” because we’re desperate to virtue-signal. In reality it’s about one thing: energy security. A lump of uranium the size of a Coke can can power your life for decades. Try doing that with windmills and solar panels in a country that spends half the year under clouds.  
And yes, China has 3,300 coal plants and is building 400 more which makes our suicidal irrational hair-shirt obsession with net zero looks even more lunatic. But here’s the difference: China also builds nuclear. 
They don’t see it as either/or, they see it as both. Nuclear back up actually. Coal keeps the lights on now, nuclear secures the furure. Profitable? Eventually, yes. ( oh gosh shall we talk AI for a moment?!) 
A nuclear plant is like building an aircraft carrier: eye-watering upfront, but once it’s there it churns out power 24/7 for 50 years at a marginal cost close to zero. Gas plants bleed you every year on fuel imports, nuclear doesn’t. France has had cheap, reliable power for half a century precisely because it built a fleet of reactors while we were still arguing about coal strikes. Nuclear isn’t about being “green”, as to profitable? Only if you measure profit over decades, not quarterly earnings.
[27/08/2025, 10:48:21] ~ Matt H: EDF went bust and had to be nationalised by the French government. The French government required EDF to sell power below the cost. Tax payers stumped up €10bn.

[27/08/2025, 12:14:37] Nick finegold: Nikon Corp.’s Tokyo-traded shares shot up 21%, the most they’ve ever risen in a day, after Bloomberg reported that Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica is exploring a deal to more than double its stake in Nikon to about 20%. The companies have operated an eyewear joint venture since 2000.

As for predictions, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica expects to produce 10 million units annually by the end of 2026, indicating a strong demand for the product. Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned that the sales of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have exceeded expectations, with engagement and retention rates higher than the previous version.

*Sales Figures:*

- *2024 Sales:* 1 million units
- *Total Sales (Oct 2023 - present):* Over 2 million units

*Predicted Sales:*

- *Annual Production Capacity (by end of 2026):* 10 million units
- *Projected Sales for 2025:* Between 2 and 5 million units¹ ² ³

[27/08/2025, 13:40:35] ~ William Nutting: Miliband lying incessantly today just shows its getting close to the end of ideology and ignorance meeting economic reality head-on. 
Miliband has nowhere to go until its time for whisky and service revolver time. 
It is still just extraordinary that he’s allowed to lie so bare- facedly and the media seem incapable of calling him out on any effective way. Lets be clear, If it was reliance on fossil fuels as he states is the issue  (forgetting that in real terms the gas price is back to 2018 lows) why does it effect only the UK and no one country who have lower bills !?
[27/08/2025, 16:46:20] ~ Jason M: Anyone any views on lithium?
All the momentum junkies were widely bullish a couple of years ago. Price down 85%.
Mining people I listen too suggesting now interesting. The problem has I am told not been demand growth which has been strong as predicted but supply growth and therefore inventories. This oversupply is starting to ease and there have been mining shutdowns in China.
I appreciate short term it’s rallied a bit off the bottom but looks great on 2/3 year view.
Maybe less consensus than the rare earth mania?
[27/08/2025, 17:14:37] ~ Matt H: Only some market news: Lithium - Chinese lithium prices retreat, but peak-season restocking gains momentum (Platts):  Chinese domestic lithium spot prices fell in the week ended Aug. 22, as sentiment weakened following a sharp drop in lithium carbonate futures on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange. Market participants attributed the futures decline to aggressive long liquidation rather than fundamentals. As spot prices slipped below Yuan 83,000/mt, trading activity picked up sharply. Sources said the lower prices encouraged downstream restocking. A major battery maker was heard reducing the supply of lithium carbonate to its cathode customers as its lepidolite mine suspended production, while other cathode producers replenished inventories ahead of the September–October peak season.
=> Asia seaborne lithium inch lower tracking domestic lithium prices: Asian seaborne lithium saw a slight downtrend Aug. 22, tracking the domestic Chinese lithium chemical prices. An offer for battery-grade lithium carbonate on a CIF North Asia basis was reported at $9,600/mt on Aug. 22.
"There's been more inquiries in the market for battery-grade lithium carbonate for imports to China," said a trader, however, cautioning that he was unsure if it was driven by actual demand or sentiments. The trader maintained that the lithium market remained in a surplus.
[27/08/2025, 21:52:38] ~ Dipesh Patel: Another set of iffy nos from CRWD. Missing Q3 guidance and talking about corporates not spending....on them! Polar opposite of Nvidia re corporate spending. Still puzzled how CRWD is not crushing it on data centre rollouts. Cashflow still v poor running at a tad over $1bn on a $100bn mkt cap. It's been a decent short against all time mkt highs and still has more to go in my view.
[27/08/2025, 22:13:49] ~ William Nutting: NVIDIA: This is one of those sets of numbers that makes you rub your eyes and check you haven’t added an extra zero by mistake. 
Key takeaways: Feck all here to turn this charging 🦬 . 
“Shoot a Short in the back of the head Never in the face!”

On details:
Blowout revenue: $46.7B vs $46.1B expected. That’s more than Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm combined in a quarter, and that’s all before the China tap even turns back on.
Data Center clear dominance: $41.1B from Data Center alone (basically all AI GPUs);
88% of sales. 
This is a single-product cycle on steroids.
Margins are also fattening up: 74% gross margin vs est. 72%.
Nvidia isn’t just selling more, it’s doing so at Apple-like profitability. 
Guidance is nuclear: Q3 revenue guide $54B vs est. $46B. That’s another “beat next quarter before it’s even started.”
Capital return: $60B buyback authorisation that’s more than the entire market cap of AMD!!!
The kicker: Not a single H20 chip (China-compliant AI GPU) included. Zero! 
If/when that revenue comes back, it’s all incremental.  
Through a Valuation lens: At $205/share, you’re talking a $5T valuation trajectory. Bears will keep muttering “bubble,” but if you annualise Q3 guidance, Nvidia is running > $200B revenue, > $150B gross profit, growing at 100%+ YoY. That’s not tulip mania, that’s just an entire new layer!
[27/08/2025, 22:25:27] Nick finegold: If you listen to the moonshot podcast I posted the head of chat GPT product said that the demand for GPU’s was infinite . 

Ie the supply constraints lie in the foundries and whether everyone can just carry on paying for infinite number of GPU’s they need. ‎<This message was edited>

[28/08/2025, 07:19:55] ~ Dipesh Patel: Horizon Robotics numbers look good. Talking about competition coming from Nvidia but similar eye watering numbers. New guidance is v punchy ADS revs +47% 2025. Talking about 500% increase in ADS profit by 2030. Guiding to ship 13,000 units by 2030 from 450 in 2024 (not typos). Explains the Qualcomm Auto numbers as cars shift to more and more ADS.

[28/08/2025, 07:37:54] Nick finegold: Donald Trump promised to halve electricity bills within a year of taking office, but instead prices are rising sharply as utilities face ageing infrastructure, surging demand from AI data centres, EVs and industry, and record capital expenditure. His tariffs, curbs on renewables and reliance on costly fossil fuels are driving costs higher, making his pledge increasingly unrealistic.

Surging US electricity prices put Trump pledge in jeopardy

[28/08/2025, 07:47:26] ~ Dipesh Patel: Chinese supplier of chips to BYD and others incl VOW. Chips that specifically focus on ADS. Wrote about it before on the chat. They are the defacto  play for 'robotics' chips in cars. It is possible the ADS numbers from Horizon are reflective of where the Qualcomm nos may go which is why it was a buy on the sell off after numbers (results release worth a read). Qualcomm might not have quite the same quantum of delta given size and breadth of business but both companies appear to be highlighting material/massive growth from demand for chips in ADS
[28/08/2025, 07:53:36] ~ JB: Will Ocado every make a profit / positive ROIC?  By when and how?

*Horizon Robotics* – *“Nvidia of the East”*

Horizon stands out as a *uniquely profitable* AI/robotics company. Its chips power *BYD* and most leading Chinese smart vehicles.

[28/08/2025, 09:04:38] ~ Robin Maxwell: (eyecare/opticians/ EL watchers) FIELMANN - Announced 2Q and 1H results today. Top line growth momentum maintained at +12.9% yoy. 2025 guidance maintained. The stock is off 7% as 2Q EBITDA margins came in a tiny bit light at 22.5%. Indeed the £30m topline increment in 2Q vs Q1'25 doesn't appear to have added any profit at first glance. Second glance may paint a different picture as the 2Q was also affected by first time consolidation of Shopko optical. That impact falls out of 2H25. Interesting is that the USA is already their second largest market. Will be wanting to explore that more in the context of their global ambitions as made public in their Vision 2035 published in July. I am considering buying more on this dip in illiquid markets but will listen to call / talk to company first.

NEW: AM ADDING TO SOLANA: Solana to me looks like it is primed and set to re-rate back to $300 (from $208) relatively quickly, their DAT moment is now coming.
The laggard of the big 3 & the SOHO House Nutstuff WOULD buy!(see below for more colour).  If ETH is the nerdy corporate Windows computer buyer in the IT bowels of the bank. Solana is that smug bloke in Soho House waving his funky new iMac around until it overheats and crashes. See that Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto are all reportedly working to raise $1 billion for a dedicated solana treasury. The plan would create the largest structured reserve of solana to date, signalling deep institutional confidence in the blockchain.  
Top 5 here are: STSS UPXI DFDV MFH ISPC They are stocks not tokens!

Think DePIN, think HELIUM/ See this latest on the coming MOBILE REVOLUTION: This is NEW. Solana seem to think this new mobile phone is an apple beater. Who knows. Can’t work out if delusional or genius. But start to think about the Apple 30% App Store rake and its pain mitigated doe developers by porting to Solana.  https://solanamobile.com/
[28/08/2025, 09:06:39] ~ William Nutting: 🇬🇧 The UK paying a “moron premium” on 30-year UK gilts is a stark reality. Neil Woodford, remember him?  He says talk of a £50bn black-hole is bollochox! “If growth muddles along at even 2% a year slightly below Britain’s long-term average of 2.1-2.3%), then by 2027/28 the current budget is in surplus. Not deficit. Surplus. And the overall budget deficit falls to 2% of GDP by 2029/30. So why the hysteria? Simple: because NIESR are using growth forecasts so bleak they’d have you off to Exit. They say growth of 1.3% this year, 1.2% next year, then 1.1% for three more years. That’s basically predicting Britain’s economy will spend the next five years pretending to be Belgium.” 
Again to repeat: Nutstuff sees opportunity. “Am I the only person thinking Rachel from accounts now has no option but to switch the North Sea back on.?” Miliband lying incessantly again yesterday on the £300 number just shows they are getting ever closer to the end of ideology and ignorance meeting economic reality head-on. Miliband has nowhere to go until its time for his whisky and service revolver “decent thing” time. It is still just extraordinary that he’s allowed to lie so bare-facedly and the media seem incapable of calling him out on any effective way. Lets be clear, If it was reliance on fossil fuels as he states is the issue  (forgetting that in real terms the gas price is back to 2018 lows) why does it effect only the UK and no one country who have lower bills !? 
Nutstuff Focus remains amongst others:  JOG LN, KISTOS, ITHACA , EUROPA.
[28/08/2025, 09:12:40] ~ David Haysey: Not sure if many care on this but Tungsten get Letter of Intent from US Exim bank for $95m funding predicated on project’s offtake agreement with US buyers. Not a firm commitment. I’m taking some profit but thanks to whoever had this idea.

[28/08/2025, 09:17:14] ~ William Nutting: Nutstuff might take a smidge of credit but met them and then saw CEO post Lansdowne day! 

TUNGSTEN: China’s dominance in critical-mineral mining and processing grants it a substantial advantage and jeopardises global supply-chain reliability. Tungsten is one such critical mineral. Tungsten is significant in several industries due to its exceptional properties, including its melting point (3,442°C), the highest among metals; high density; extreme hardness; and appropriate electrical and thermal conductivity. Additionally, its chemical stability and corrosion resistance make it perfect for industrial applications. Unlike lead and uranium, tungsten is non-toxic and environmentally harmless, making it a preferred material in specialised equipment. The U.S. hasn’t mined tungsten in a decade, whereas China supplies 82.7% of global consumption. According to the latest United States Geological Survey (USGS) data, China holds over 52% of international reserves, while the U.S. has zero.  Vietnam is the second-largest miner, supplying 4.2% of global production, followed by Russia and North Korea at 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Together with China, the four countries produce over 90% of the world’s tungsten. More importantly, Vietnam’s production relies on a single mine (Nui Phao, the largest mine outside China), which has reported a steady drop in output from around 4,800 tons in 2022 to 3,400 tons in 2024, owing primarily to deteriorating-ore grades. Tungsten is a pivotal mineral for innovating and making next-generation technologies more efficient. In the military sector, tungsten is vital for armor-piercing munitions, tank armor, and missiles. It is also an essential raw material for Abram M1 tanks, the Phalanx anti-missile Gatling guns, GNU-44 Viper strike missiles, and hypersonic weapons. Due to its extreme-heat resistance, tungsten enhances the efficiency of solar panels, semiconductors, robotics, and nuclear-fusion reactors. There IS a very real UK play: TUNGSTEN LN.

- Trades on a c.60% discount to NAV
- ⁠Buyback shares - Since July 2024 the aggregate value of repurchased shares is up to £40 million
- Stabilisation of interest rates provides the potential for stronger exit markets ahead⁠

🙋🏼‍♀️ Anyone have a view?
[28/08/2025, 10:53:34] ~ Charlie Morris: I hold it. Seems straightforward and rising nav unlike IPO. But won’t fly until PE valuations are believed. GROW has conservative accounting and so well placed.
[28/08/2025, 11:01:22] ~ Mike Townend: I like their portfolio slightly later stage than IPG and more focus  to Europe.  My view - Suspect that the general sector discount narrows to 40% . I also think sector consolidation is likely as large shareholders are unwilling to invest further so operating costs need to reduce. 
I also think there is a fair chance of some activist activity.
[28/08/2025, 11:07:39] ~ Mike Townend: Sale of Organox ( Oxford spin out) for £1.5 b  to Japan pharma is a big event for Oxford . Worth noting that BGF made the most cash on the investment having come in with a rescue round

[28/08/2025, 21:24:00] Nick finegold: Newmont (NYSE:NEM) may impose deep job cuts as part of a sweeping cost-cutting drive, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.

Newmont's (NYSE:NEM) costs jumped following its $15B acquisition of Newcrest Mining in 2023, with its all-in sustaining costs rising to an all-time high earlier this year, taking a chunk out of strong earnings generated by record gold prices that hit an all time high of $3,500/oz in April.

The world's largest gold miner reportedly has told managers it wants to be more in line with its lowest-cost peers, which would mean cutting costs by as much as $300/oz, or ~20%.
[29/08/2025, 00:40:27] ~ Matt H: August 28, 2025 – Vancouver, BC: Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. (“Elemental Altus” or “the Company”) (TSX-V: ELE, OTCQX: ELEMF) is pleased to announce that it has agreed to open an institutional account to gain access to Tether Gold (“XAUt”), a regulated, gold-backed digital asset. This forms part of a strategy to diversify the Company’s treasury and increase exposure to rising gold prices with enhanced liquidity and efficiency.

Highlights
Elemental Altus has established an institutional account to gain exposure to XAUt – a tokenised asset backed 1:1 by physical gold
XAUt is directly redeemable and fully backed by allocated gold bars held in Swiss vaults
The digital format allows for instant settlement, 24/7 liquidity, and no custody fees
Aligns with the Company’s strategy to preserve value from excess cash through low-risk, inflation-hedging instruments
"XAUt is positioning itself as a promising standard for the new era of gold markets digital and real-time settlements and its rapid adoption will generate countless opportunities” said Juan Sartori, Executive Chairman of Elemental Altus.

[29/08/2025, 07:28:12] Nick finegold: For anyone not on Jonny Haycock’s newsletter on gold & silver it’s excellent and here’s a summary . 

Gold vs. Treasuries: A Historic Shift
	•	For the first time since 1996, foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries (Tavi Costa). Echoes of the 1970s suggest this could be the start of a major global rebalancing.

Drivers of Demand
	1.	China: Regulators already require big insurers to hold 1% of assets in physical gold. That may soon apply to all insurers, with the quota rising to 5% — a seismic shift.
	2.	India: Pension funds may lift their 5% cap on gold ETFs, adding institutional weight in one of the world’s largest gold markets. ETF assets already grew 96% YoY.
	3.	GLD: A record $1bn dark-pool trade went through this week — likely sovereign wealth fund buying.

Silver Joins the Party
	•	U.S. added silver to its Strategic Minerals list for the first time — key for defence, EVs, solar. At $39/oz, silver is far below its 2011 peak ($48) and deeply undervalued relative to gold. Tight physical supply suggests any new buyer could trigger a price spike.

Macro Backdrop
	•	In the UK, economists warn Rachel Reeves may need an IMF bailout to stabilize government finances. Long-end gilt yields are already higher than during the Liz Truss crisis — bond markets may act before the Autumn budget.

The Big Picture
	•	After months of consolidation, gold and silver face converging tailwinds: central banks, insurers, pensions, SWFs, and geopolitics.
	•	Pressure is building for the next leg higher.

👉 The only question: do you have enough?

This is a long term play and this plant alone will generate £60m of ebitda at today’s prices . How that falls through to the plc we need more information on but there will be other projects behind this.

[29/08/2025, 08:31:52] ~ William Nutting: Was just talking to George Olver and discussing this and is a significant and important move in Digital Asset land ( as are Solana & DAT moves)

Tether launching USDT natively on Bitcoin is a big signal. It shows they’re not just chasing faster chains (like Tron/Solana) but deliberately anchoring to the most secure, decentralised network. By using Taproot Assets + RGB they can make USDT transfers instant via Lightning while settling back to Bitcoin. That means speed + scale + Bitcoin’s trust. It signals Tether sees Bitcoin as the long-term foundation for money not just digital gold but the rails to underpin stable currency flows. This is their clearest move yet that BTC is where they want to root their system.
[29/08/2025, 08:35:33] Nick finegold: Will I just asked chat gpt to translate this so I could understand because I am thick . This is what it came up with .

Tether (the company behind USDT, the biggest stablecoin) is now building directly on Bitcoin.

👉 That means USDT will be faster (using Lightning), safer (because it’s on Bitcoin), and more reliable long term.

The big idea: Tether is showing it sees Bitcoin not just as “digital gold” you hold, but as the foundation for moving money around the world.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/08/30/badenoch-no-more-net-zero-extract-every-drop-oil-north-sea/

Nutstuff happy to see Kemi Badenoch has decided to stop dressing up in the sackcloth of net zero piety and instead has put on a hard hat and a pair of steel-toed boots. 
At last a politician prepared to utter the heresy: maybe we shouldn’t deliberately bankrupt ourselves by leaving the oil and gas under our feet while buying it from the Norwegians at a premium. It’s taken years, but the penny seems to have finally dropped, the climate cultists don’t care if your pension vanishes, your bills triple and half the country freezes, so long as they can prattle on about “targets” for 2050 that no one on earth will ever meet. So now Badenoch says: scrap the Transition Authority, ditch the “transition,” and drill every last drop out of the North Sea. Cue the squealing from Ed Miliband the man who thinks the way to bring down bills is to build wind turbines we have to pay to switch off.  Norway’s making a fortune. Britain’s making excuses. And while the French riot over pensions and the Germans burn lignite, we’ve been busy vandalising our own energy security in the name of moral superiority.  So yes at last, a bit of common sense. Drill, baby, drill. About bloody time someone in Westminster grew a pair.

[31/08/2025, 07:56:11] Nick finegold: On the matter of the energy transition Ironically, the AI boom — with its insatiable appetite for power — is accelerating the nuclear renaissance faster than policymakers ever imagined. While fission is re-entering Frey as another scalable baseload solution, as many now place their hopes on AI itself to help crack fusion. If breakthroughs arrive between now and 2050, as some predict, that may prove to be humanity’s best chance at truly completing the energy transition.

In 16 of the last 18 times the S&P ended August at an ‘ all time high’ , it fell on average 1.6% in september…….however , i am more concerned by the absurdity of this stat…At $4.4 trillion, NVIDIA is now bigger than the entire equity markets of five of the seven G7 countries—Italy, Germany, France, the U.K., and Canada

[01/09/2025, 12:36:17] Nick finegold: It’s almost like going back to school. .  Relearning everything I have been taught. It’s impossible to be a market participant without in some way understanding how up and coming generations think about things differently . That doesn’t mean throwing everything we have ever learnt out the window , it just means that historic data may not be that relevant when there is a paradigm shift at a velocity that is almost incomprehensible to most of us . It means staying informed and and maintaining a thirst for education at a time in our life when many think they may want to kick back with what they already know .

[01/09/2025, 13:14:41] ~ Stretch: It’s very interesting, but the question you have to ask yourself is this is Balaji Srinivasan talented. I would say not. Yes there are many people who played for Manchester United, but there were also many untalented people who played for Manchester United. You may have been in Coinbase and you may have been in Andreeson Horowitz but you can only be judged what you did when you were there. So you founded a genetic testing company good for you. What else have you done? The most worrying thing about his narrative is his absolute belief in it. Whenever I see a person without doubt, I generally increase my own doubt. Very interesting podcast though a good listen.
[01/09/2025, 13:16:22] ~ Philip Donald: I would add…..There are a lot of untalented people still playing for manchester united
[01/09/2025, 13:19:07] Nick finegold: Venture & Crypto
	•	Andreessen Horowitz (2013–2018) – Served as a General Partner, helping lead early crypto investments (he was one of the big internal champions of Bitcoin/Ethereum inside a16z).
	•	Coinbase (2018–2019) – After Earn.com was acquired, he became CTO of Coinbase.
	•	Pushed Coinbase deeper into crypto products beyond trading.
	•	Left in 2019.

⸻

📚 Public Intellectual & Author
	•	The Network State (2022) – His book argues that online communities can form new nations, first digitally, then physically, using crypto as their financial rails.
	•	Active commentator on crypto, tech, and geopolitics — widely followed on X/Twitter.

⸻

🎯 Other Highlights
	•	Angel Investor – Backed many startups in crypto, health tech, and frontier tech.
	•	Teaching – Taught courses at Stanford in bioinformatics and machine learning.
	•	The “Bitcoin bet” (2023) – Famously bet $1m that Bitcoin would reach $1m in 90 days as a statement on fiat debasement (he later settled the bet, framing it more as a publicity stunt to highlight systemic risk).

⸻

👉 In short:
	•	Biotech founder → VC partner → Crypto founder → Coinbase CTO → Author/futurist
	•	His career is unusual in that he bridges life sciences, computer science, and crypto-finance — not many people move across those worlds successfully.

ASPI has essentially gone from being a crackpot isotope science project in a shed to running three enrichment plants, shipping actual product: Silicon-28 and Ytterbium-176 and now staring at $50–70m of revenue in the next two years just off those two. They’ve got more plants in the works for Gadolinium, Zinc, Nickel, and the lithium that everyone from AI data-centres to nuclear navies will be scrapping over. On top of that, they’re merging with Renergen, which means helium, LNG and a vertical stack of “critical materials” for semis, reactors and medicine. This is not some penny-stock dream. They’ve got PET Labs churning out record doses of medical isotopes, giving free treatments to children in South Africa (think SA government goodwill), they’re spinning out Quantum Leap Energy for HALEU fuel, they’ve just listed in Johannesburg to tap new capital pools, and institutional ownership is already over 70%.
The Management bench has gone from two blokes and a Bunsen burner to 170 PhDs and ex-army planners.
Valuation? Yes, it’s a run, but you’re buying a first-mover in one of the rarest businesses on Earth, isotope enrichment all tied directly into megatrends: nuclear power, semiconductors, oncology. 
Management reckon $300m in EBITDA by 2030 and Mkt cap today of $850m.
Even if they miss, you’ve still got a company controlling bottlenecks that Washington, Beijing, and every hospital oncology ward can’t live without.

It is reassuring to know I am
NOT alone in finding things to own in the UK market. Good friend and confidant Jim Mellon also agrees.

On a wider Thematic sense Nutstuff has banged on incessantly about “MASLOWS HIERARCHY OF NEEDS” when thinking about Portfolio exposures. Owning the trifecta of mistrust (Bitcoin & Gold), necessity (Oil and security & Defence), and scarcity (Uranium).

As it becomes ever clearer that in so-called “Developed” economies Debt, entitlement and excessive spending remains the massive issues and Bond markets and currencies sniff Blood!  For all the UK doom & gloom the Smarter macro watchers tell me very near-term that the Gilt market here might bounce because BofE will stop duty! But post that sugar bump, the scare comes back, then Rachel and her cabal panic and the Market will demand a budget..
WHAT CAN THEY DO?!!! 
There is only 1 big thing and one that can take a pathetic £6.2bn over the last 3 yrs of punishment tax ( tx Rishi and JHunt!) and turn it into £70-100bn of real tax revenue and £200bn of EVA..

I go through the Colour / rough maths and the best way to position.

[04/09/2025, 06:22:23] ~ Katie Jackson: FT Big Read: How to make British homes affordable again…

https://on.ft.com/46iEfno


🇬🇧🏠 *UK Housing Market – Dysfunction at its Core*
	•	House prices have quadrupled since 1997, far outpacing incomes.
	•	Problems: poor housing stock, high rents, shrinking social housing, rising homelessness.
	•	Land, not buildings, makes up 70%+ of home value – fuelling rent-seeking over productivity.
	•	Supply-side focus (1.5m new homes) won’t fix affordability – evidence suggests the issue is more about demand, credit liberalisation, and unequal distribution.
	•	Current property taxes (stamp duty, council tax) distort the market.

*Conclusion:*
True reform needs bold land and property tax changes – not just more building. Without addressing affordability, land values, and tax distortions, the UK’s housing dysfunction will persist.
[04/09/2025, 06:27:05] ~ Katie Jackson: Start with 
1. An audit on the number of empty units in the UK
2. ⁠Annual Tax on empty units owned by foreigners if not rented out
[04/09/2025, 06:55:36] ~ William Nutting: SAF/ sustainable airline fuel. Another green unicorn gets taken out to the reality house and is shot! Was wheeled out by Rachel to justify Heathrow expansion, but guess what,  less than 0.1% of flights use it today, anyone guess why?!  Shell just axed a $785m SAF plant in Rotterdam, BP too scaling back, yes, political spin over industrial reality. Yet another credibility hit to a bunch of charmless incompetents flogging fantasy while lining up more taxes to make the numbers work.

[04/09/2025, 09:49:00] ~ Katie Jackson: *COLLECTIVE 30 CANDIDATE*

🧿 *3i Group*: The Action-Packed Compounding Machine

3i isn’t your typical PE firm. It’s capital-light, cash-rich, and built around *Action* - Europe’s fastest-growing discount retailer.

📈 *Since 2012*, under Simon Borrows, NAV/share has grown 9×, TSR CAGR >20%, and the dividend’s up 20% YoY.

*🎯 The Thesis:*

- *Action = The Engine* → 2,900+ stores, €2.3bn run-rate EBITDA, 6.9% LFL growth YTD. Mgmt sees capacity to *triple* footprint.
- *Simon Borrows = The Edge* → Rare capital allocator. £700m skin in the game. High ROIC, low churn, no hype.
- *Cash Machine* → £2.4bn realised in 2025, 3% gearing, rising dividends, no external LPs.

*Catalysts 🔜:*

- 📆 Near term: More store rollouts + realisations (MPM was 3.2x MoM).
- 🛒 Medium: Action expands into new markets (Portugal, Romania, UK/US optionality).
- 🧬 Long term: New “Action-like” bets (Royal Sanders, EBG) + clarity on succession.

In a market full of noise, 3i is disciplined, shareholder-friendly, and still under-owned.

Premium? Yes. But sometimes *you pay up for quality*.

Seperate question on the handicap one places on them for not taking their retail/private investors seriously enough… ‎<This message was edited>
[04/09/2025, 11:21:45] Nick finegold: Goldman Sachs analysts say growing concerns regarding US institutional credibility could lead to commodity price spikes, including in gold, as investors hedge against inflation. The bank laid out a range of outcomes, noting that if just 1% of the privately owned US Treasury market were to flow into gold, it would boost the metal to almost $5,000 an ounce.
[04/09/2025, 11:29:04] ~ Jonny Haycock: Thx Nick. But as you know, it’s not about the price of gold and silver. It’s the coming collapse of fiat that matters as govts are forced to print to the moon.
[04/09/2025, 11:36:51] ~ Jonny Haycock: Gold and silver simply starting to reflect that outcome.
[04/09/2025, 11:46:42] ~ Richard Windsor: exactly... Gold and Silver are not going up... Fiat currencies are going down.
[04/09/2025, 11:57:24] ~ Jonny Haycock: Yup. And this critical point is lost on the mainstream 99% of the population well beyond this esteemed group! That’s why buying tax free gold and silver Britannias is a no brainer today for U.K. tax residents.

It’s a reasonable concern, but it isn’t new. In the 4th century BC, it became the trend for “chic philosophers” in Athens to sell written copies of their lectures to the young elite strivers of the day. Plato wrote a dialogue, Phaedrus, in which Socrates complains that the young are addling their minds by outsourcing their memories to the hypey gadget of the day: “papyrus”.

[05/09/2025, 09:24:28] ~ William Nutting: QUANTUM COMPUTING/UK: Hats off to Brit Ilyas Khan for raising cash for Quantinuum at a $10bn valuation in its latest fundraising. For those head-scratching Normal computers are basically light switches, billions of them, that flip between 0 and 1 really fast. Quantum computers are more like a pint of Guinness that can be both full and empty at the same time until you look at it. That’s because the “quantum bits” (qubits) can be 0, 1, or both, thanks to spooky physics. Stack enough of these Guinness-bits together and you can, in theory, solve certain problems millions of times faster than even the beefiest supercomputer. Yes, yes this is the threat to Bitcoin et al, but frankly the Bitcoin network will patch itself and restore much quicker than Banking and Enterprise security so spare me the tales ofrypto Doom from your Web 2.0 world!
[05/09/2025, 09:58:57] ~ David Haysey: The odds here are very tasty if you buy this line (I don’t). 50-1 on a GE this year, 20-1 next year.
[05/09/2025, 10:25:59] ~ David Haysey: Breedon. Vertically integrated aggregates biz (also in Ireland and US). Aggregates tho cyclical is attractive as high barriers to entry and decent pricing power as material  generally a small part of project costs. Difficulties of UK market means has struggled of late down 24% from this years hi. 4% DY and 12x consensus PE.
Also in UK own Vesuvius a niche global leader in the pretty unsexy biz of steel industry consumables. Better returns than ‘big steel’ and a bit more differtiated. Not a particular play on the uk tho. PE 11x DY 6%.
Have owned Greggs for 20 years and it’s halved from top. Solid at this level and still seems the favourite at motorway service stations. Probably not an obvs ‘event’ play though.
Intrigued by Ashmore (EM debt manager); if $ to be weak and DM debt screwed this category should do well. Massive insider ownership. Suspect are over distributing. Does anyone know these folks or have a view?
[05/09/2025, 12:10:29] ~ SSCOOK: ASHM - reported FY results today and the -6% reaction shows that their problems in core EM debt biz  (50% of AUM) continues to weigh on them. 

For FY 25 group outflows were 12% of beg AUM and EM debt fee erosion continues - management fees are down to 25-30bps. Their local currency EM biz (the gem of group) has been hit hardest by outflows so not seeing any tailwind from DM debt coming their way…yet through end of June.  Looks like spreads on their all their EM products are already tight relative to recent history so this may not be the catalyst unless it can push into a new range. Strangely, their EM debt performance has been pretty good in 1 & 3 year view but has not been able to stop outflow momentum. 

Best part of story is DPS yield 11% and xs capital 45% of market cap (they have never bought back shares). I like your point on inside ownership and have often wondered when they would sell. Shockingly their AUM is $48bn at June 2025 down from $94bn in June 2021 so they really missed out a lot not cashing out earlier. 

Commentary on EM is positive - has been all the way down and sounds like they are pushing how well their EM equity biz (18% of AUM) is doing and not their EM debt so much…

Hope the helps.

[05/09/2025, 19:00:52] ~ Jim: Hi Philip, they are slightly different business models. Coinshares is essentially an asset manager whose revenue is fee linked to the funds they manage. It’s roughly 70% from Bitcoin related ETP’s and the rest is Solana and Ethereum. They also have income lines from staking, advisory and trading. They currently have a net cash position. If you assume current asset prices the earnings power from here is $200m pa. The current market cap is $800m so is on a forward p/e today of 4x. The cash conversion is huge so ex investments the free cashflow yield is north of 20%. So with Coinshares you are playing predominantly Bitcoin with a sprinkling of Ethereum and Solana but   I think the upside comes with the rerating. It’s appallingly covered given its legacy Swedish listing but hopefully the proposed move to the US will help realise the inherent value . Club call with Coinshares on 17th Sept.
[06/09/2025, 08:14:27] ~ William Nutting: In simpler terms: 
Coinbase is the slick casino,
$50bn market cap, hyped to the moon, one regulator away from obliteration but just mints money when volumes rip. CoinShares is the scruffy bookmaker in Jersey tiny mkt cap, steady ETP fees, real dividends, valued like it’s one scandal from zero. One is flashy Vegas glitz, the other’s a cheap pint in a pub. 
So, Coinbase = high-beta trade on digital asset mania.
CoinShares = a asymmetric “sleeper” on similar with some takeover optionality.
Hope helpful…

Reform fatigue setting in within Argentina? Milei's party lost local elections in Buenos Aires yesterday (Sunday) which is a big blow to them. 
Human's can endure significant pain but the irony is, take them out of a system they have got accustomed to, one of over regulation, hyper inflation and government handouts, and they are hard pressed to see the forest from the trees and look a few years out to a better future. That's the exact reason Europe will continue to degrade unfortunately...the depressed economic and social vibes are simply accepted and taken as standard. Asia is the polar opposite.
Argentinian trading will be volatile this week for those who own shares.

[08/09/2025, 16:59:15] ~ Andrew Draycott: Lithium remains one of the most cyclical commodities today—not because demand is weak, but because the industry is still maturing. Short-term price swings are often driven by small, fragmented supply sources, yet demand continues to grow strongly. Once dominated by the EV narrative, the outlook is now substantially amplified by the rise in battery energy storage systems (BESS). This shift is widely recognized—including in recent Goldman Sachs research highlighting the surge in energy storage deployments that underpin expanding lithium requirements.

Africa illustrates this dual reality well. It is home to two of the top five lithium deposits globally—Goulamina in Mali and Manono in the DRC—demonstrating its importance as a future hub of large-scale supply. At the same time, the continent also saw a wave of low-cost artisanal production enter the market in the last cycle, pushing prices down. That artisanal supply is inherently unsustainable and difficult to grow, and as the industry matures, it is becoming far less influential. Instead, the market is being reshaped around scalable Tier 1 assets, which require higher, stable prices to justify the capital and operating expenditure needed to bring them online.

Lithium Argentina stands out as a rare, world-class platform, backed by Ganfeng—the world’s largest integrated lithium company. It gives investors direct exposure to one of the most strategic producing regions on the planet, with access to capital, technical capability, and offtake that others simply cannot match. The current downturn offers a compelling entry point: valuations today reflect the bottom of the cycle, not the future tightening of supply against structural demand. For investors seeking optionality, Lithium Africa—also partnered with Ganfeng—provides a speculative, higher-risk avenue into Africa’s emerging potential.

[08/09/2025, 20:36:55] ~ Matt H: In my opinion China controls most of the minor metals in the world. Lithium had a huge rise a few years ago because the local & governmental agencies in China would only issue permits to build battery factories that could secure mineral supply and prove it( not just lithium, nickel, manganese etc) . All the battery manufacturers competed with each other to secure supply and prices went parabolic in for want of a better term the gold rush(EV/battrey rush). Lithium is one of the most abundant minerals in the world and isn’t that difficult to extract with some Chinese miners being able to bring on supply in 12 months. The Chinese control  lithium and other minor metals & after the initial rush they know exactly what the cost of production is globally and will let producers make a small margin, enough to keep them going, to ensure there is a stable supply but they don’t let prices run too high as it is to their determent. Lithium is in this category and while you will see price movements the Chinese will quash it if runs too hard. 
Rare earths and some other minor metals which are not abundant are different. The US and Europe have woken up to the fact that outsourced environmental pollution that comes with the processing of these metals is almost solely controlled by the Chinese and while there are rare earths deposits in the West and Africa the environmental cost of producing them is hard to stomach. They are very dirty. Building smelters and refineries is tough. The State department has a huge focus on securing minerals considered essential for US security. It will take upto ten years or more for the US to even touch the sides of China’s dominance which means you will get wild price swings in minor metals. Lithium I am not as bullish about in the long term despite the projected demand.

Key points:
NdPr from Florida & Georgia, processed in Utah, converted into NdFeB magnets by South Korea’s largest motor core maker, fully validated by major automakers.
Enough magnets already produced to power ~1,500 EVs, with immediate entry into the supply chain.
Pilot production of 99.9% dysprosium oxide underway, with heavy REE capacity coming in 2026.
This move materially reduces reliance on China and positions Energy Fuels as the only U.S. company with a complete rare earth supply chain.
Clear strategic and commercial implications as they now enter long-term supply negotiations with global OEMs.

As this process continues there will be opportunities like this (see our UK discussion the other day). Not all gold glitters.

[10/09/2025, 07:54:15] ~ Jason M: Appreciate we said the same thing in 2000 and most including me bought Marconi, but if we stick with the things that make the kit rather than ones trying to secure the incremental revenues on AI services to me there is more runway. In 2000 it was called dark fibre for a reason it was built ahead of demand. Here demand is far ahead of the infrastructure build. I also think there are a wave of non tech construction companies that benefit. 
 On the counter argument I thought Galloway made an interesting argument the other day. 
First that there is no way incremental revenue justifies the AI spend, so it will have to be justified by cost cutting. Which means there are two options.
1/ AI does not cut the costs we think. Capex slows and the AI bubble will burst spectacularly as soon as the first company says this. 
2/ It really is that good at cutting costs 15% of the Labour force get cut and you hit recession.
Either way still think hard see why consumer stocks do not continue to fall. Employment weak and countries continue to have to raise taxes as tax take disappoints.
[10/09/2025, 08:09:16] ~ Chris Huggins: V interesting, thx. 
I think I am probably more concerned about 2 than 1!
2 also makes gold a tangential AI play, as governments will try and print. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/09/2025, 09:20:25] ~ Andrew Cawker: I noted the BLS data released yesterday. Unlike the non-farm payroll monthly estimate, this is actual job creation to March 2025. 

The headline was 911,000 fewer jobs for the 12 months than the non-farm monthly statistical models predicted. 

To @⁨~Jason M⁩ ‘s point it seems that part of this is the AI impact on the jobs created by new firms. It seems that the old ‘birth-death’ (of firms) model is failing. Historic assumptions used by the bureau of labour of job creation are off the mark. 

The jobs market seems a lot weaker than the monthly headlines would tell you.

[10/09/2025, 09:27:29] ~ JB: The Gym Group - GYM LN. 

Stronger than expected Interims reflect continued progress against the strategic objectives of the Next Chapter growth plan announced 18 months ago. 

Revenue +8% yoy 
Adj EBITDA +24%
PBT £3.3m vs £0.2 yoy
FCF £24.5m +8% yoy 
Net Debt fell by £10.1m to £51.2m

PBT forecast increases by 29% to £5.9m

On target to deliver 14-16 new sites this year. Mature and new sites performing well. 

Expect upgrades. 
Stock has been quiet ahead of these results after secondary placing at 140p and sold off late yesterday afternoon. 

Strong management executing upon a clear strategy. Buying opportunity at these levels into a compelling FCF story.

If you visit a gym 2x a week it works out at £2.50 a visit.  What can you do for £2.50 these days?

GYM will continue to take share from mid market. 

Younger generation very focused on their health.

It also does 60% of all generic drugs. If he heads down that route, we might see India stop buying Russian crude very abruptly. There is a case for crude if 11% of world supply can’t find a home to be refined.

BMNR: absolutely! 

HELIUM be patient and build posns. 

Solana ($SOL) - Breaking above $220 for the first time in 8 months triggered $10M in short liquidations. Portal to Bitcoin executed first live BTC⇆SOL swaps with $800M trading volume in 24 hours. Forward Industries announced a $1.65B war chest. The momentum is undeniable.

Hyperliquid ($HYPE) - Hit new ATH of $55.47 and now controls over 60% of the on-chain perpetual market share. Paxos released USDH v2 proposal featuring PayPal/Venmo integration with $20M ecosystem incentives. This is infrastructure dominance in action.

Ethena ($ENA) - Massive Binance integration beyond just listing - USDe as reward-bearing collateral, direct Binance Earn integration, $5M/day spot buying via DAT. USDtb becoming GENIUS compliant with plans for prime brokerage and equities perps.

Pumpfun ($PUMP) - Co-founder Noah indicates DAT implementation is "very much considered" which could add 1-5M in additional daily buying pressure to current $2M daily buybacks. Platform generates revenue equivalent to Hyperliquid despite 10x lower market cap.

Yes Oracle is suddenly the belle of the AI ball, but the real magic trick happened years ago, Larry quietly shrank the share count by 30% at a $55 average while the Street was yawning. That’s financial engineering on steroids: it turbo-charges EPS, juices the multiple, and now with AI tailwinds and a trillion-dollar valuation in sight makes Oracle look like a rocket ship. The kicker? They still need fresh financing muscle to deliver on finger in the air promises and build the data-centre empire, but to a degree the heavy lifting for shareholders is already done.

🌌 *Galaxy Digital (GLXY US) - misunderstood AI infrastructure play due a rerating*

~$8B mkt cap which could 5x in the next few years. 

Here’s why:

- *Balance Sheet Strength:* $3B+ in crypto, cash & venture investments – many not yet marked up. Strong base to fund growth without excessive dilution.
- ⁠*Helios Data Center (AI Infrastructure):* 600MW deal with CoreWeave = ~$900M annual revs at ~90% EBITDA margins. 800MW expansion approval pending - could take total revs to $2.4B+. Front of queue for 1.7GW pipeline - rare power access edge. 
- ⁠*Full-Spectrum Crypto Biz:* $10B+/qtr trading vol, 1,300+ clients, $7B AUM, 2nd/3rd largest CeFi lender, 4th largest Solana validator. JV for EU stablecoin, custody/staking infra, and new $175M VC fund. Strategic partner to crypto treasuries & TradFi entry.

*Catalysts:*
- Helios expansion approval (Q4)
- More hyperscaler deals
- Big bank research coverage (GS/MS underwrote recent $500M raise at $19)
- Possible future spin-out of data center biz

"Baidu released an upgraded version of its AI reasoning model X1.1, claiming significant enhancements in capabilities with performance surpassing DeepSeek-R1, matching OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro". Worth noting they are using their own chips. Stock still very cheap on 11x.

[12/09/2025, 08:35:23] ~ Tom Cooper: By Janet Freund and Joshua Gaunt-Warner
(Bloomberg) -- Ocado shares plunge as much as 11%,
extending losses booked in late trading on Thursday. Morgan
Stanley analysts noted “negative readacross” from comments made
on US grocer Kroger’s conference call yesterday.
* UK-based Ocado partners with Kroger in creating automated
warehouses for e-commerce, also called customer fulfillment
centers or CFCs
* Kroger said on its call Thursday that it can “offer delivery
in under two hours from 97%” of its stores, adding that the
supermarket operator is well positioned to offer customers
faster delivery times because of its “conveniently located store
network,” along with its delivery partner, Instacart
* Kroger CEO Ronald Sargent said executives are taking a “hard
look” at some of the company’s automated facilities (i.e. CFCs)
* Kroger’s strategic review, including an examination of its
ecommerce business, is “nearly complete”
* Morgan Stanley analysts Luke Holbrook (rates Ocado
underweight) and Simeon Gutman (rates Kroger equal-weight) cite
two negative takeaways from the Kroger call:
** An “increasing risk that some of Ocado’s existing CFC sites
with Kroger could be closed”
** Kroger’s heightened focus on store-fulfillment for sub-two
hour e-commerce delivery puts “a question mark on where the
long-term CFC network fits in”
* Holbrook’s “base case” on Ocado is “no new Kroger CFC
committals,” while the bear case is for closures
* Holbrook has previously written on the rise of on-demand
grocery delivery in UK, and it seems like Kroger’s comments are
supportive of a “similar trend in the US”
[12/09/2025, 08:37:26] ~ Dipesh Patel: Any view/thoughts on copper which seems to be bottoming out and perhaps catching a bid post silver and gold moves?
[12/09/2025, 08:47:34] ~ Matt H: Copper is still in surplus this year. The mention of Trump pushing Europe to put secondary tariffs on India and China over Russian oil if the US puts tarrifs on as well has seen some buying just in case it happens. In general copper trades between $9k and $10k/t with the Chinese buying at $9k and pausing buying at $10k. Freeport which has one of the largest copper copper mines in the world has temporarily shut Grassberg due to a rock slip. Miners are trapped. This has disrupted supply but it will be temporary. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/09/2025, 08:54:37] Calum Curation: ATOME is up 33% this morning after signing a definitive 10-year offtake agreement with Yara for 100% of the production from its $630m Villeta green fertiliser project. This completes the final commercial milestone ahead of financial close, now expected by year-end. It follows recent backing from the Green Climate Fund ($50m) and the European Investment Bank ($135m in-principle debt), meaning offtake, EPC, equity and debt are all in place. The market is finally starting to price in this momentum.

[12/09/2025, 11:07:16] Nick finegold: Maybe the most interesting thing about Atome is that they are creating a blue print for repetition . 

Ie we have always maintained that it’s pretty incredible that a £25m market cap company can raise £650m of debt and equity . 

The only way this is possible is by 

1) having proven technology that investors know works. 

2) having a stable and tax beneficial country in which to build the plant with plentiful clean power tied up . 

3) having a legally binding offtake agreement that means you know you will sell everything you make once it’s built. Those are the cornerstones of the financing packages it provides reasonable surety front to back. 

At current market prices this plant should do £60m+ of ebit. As I have said before we need greater clarity on how much falls through to the bottom line of the PLC . 

However , the thing the company doesn’t really talk about is that they have now established a blue print that is repeatable in other locations so plant 2 & 3 are also possible at some stage  etc . 

We shall see but an interesting one to watch .
[12/09/2025, 12:42:00] ~ William Nutting: I hope NF will allow me this…
Nutstuff is absent for 10days as most of you all know. But good to see AVIO & ATOM.

Seriously I need your help! 
The last 24 hrs has served us yet another reminder of a crazy world.
Nutting/ “Nutstuff” is here in Colombia with 30 ex servicemen and a few extraordinarily brave veterans. ( pictures paint a thousand words). We about to be run & to run them ragged for 1200 miles over the next 8days  from Cali to Medelin through the heart of “Narcos territory”. We strap them to bikes and buggies and for sure this will be fun but also these guys live for this annual trip. There are over 4000 limbless wounded ex servicemen from Afghan & Iraq alone. The Government has other priorities for our money and its not these guys. 
The Blackthorn rally is in its 10th year and after 10yrs in africa is now doing LatinAmerica. We fund it ourselves but this is also what funds it!  We aim to raise £30k and £10k has been raised so far, so whatever anyone can do here would be just massively appreciated. We also want to do some good in the Countries we go to. ( hence the Bear Cause keeps Colombian authorities happy!)!
You can see that £500-1000 Will make a massive difference.
Colum and Lamin here both ex. Irish Guards both hit by IED’s in Afghanistan 2011. 
( Lamins happened on New Years Eve, let that sink in).

[12/09/2025, 14:48:12] ~ Chris Dale: By the way Vestas, VWS DC is a good short. Lots of accounting issues but 3 bits of news flow yday. 1) Merz is saying they will spend less in renewables (this is the most important mkt), 2) GE talking down the US onshore mkt due to ambiguities in tariffs and permitting 3) most important medium term is that octopus energy production in the U.K. are partnering with Chinese OEM Ming Yang for 6 GW which brings Chinese turbines to the UK for the first time. These are 30-50% cheaper. This was viewed as not possible 2 years ago and that the non Chinese mkt would be a 3 player mkt with Vestas number 1. This is now another industry where Chinese competition is arriving with a cheaper product just as demand is questionable.

[12/09/2025, 16:38:02] ~ KC Shetty: I have no  expertise to value add  but sharing below , from a friend, on BMNR, as mentioned often here...



We looked at them a couple of years ago, as bankers were pitching them as a distressed asset. Tom Lee is a great guy, but the mNAV premium for his DAT has has all but disappeared, and the ability to generate an mNAV premium without levering up is difficult, even with a rock star like Tom. We had dinner at a table with Michael Saylor last night, and his big pitch is to utilize preferred shares to create layers of debt that effectively never mature and require very little share dilution to cover the cost of dividends. Of course, all of this works in bull markets; it is not clear how Strategy will fare when the market goes south, as Strategy had an mNAV discount for a while in the past bear market. All that being said, Saylor is reasonably humble in all of this, and he knows there are limitations on a DAT strategy.
[12/09/2025, 16:40:18] ~ Chris Dale: Not sure on that one. The one I don’t like is EDPR
[12/09/2025, 17:44:04] ~ Adam Calman: Really sorry to hear about Richard‘s situation. I myself had a brain tumour, albeit thankfully benign, 10 years ago. 

My experience on insurance is as follows, albeit not on health, but on income replacement. Understanding small print and nuanced tax law, saved me a fortune.

I had an income replacement policy through LivVic, on which I was given advice by my IFA to pay for myself, out of PAYE taxed income, rather than my employer paying the premiums for me and then treating that policy as a benefit in kind.

The result, when I successfully claimed the income replacement, following my brain surgery and subsequent “retirement” due to the mental effects from the brain surgery, was that the “salary” was paid gross, without any income tax deducted. 

The revenue deems this a non-taxable payment, from an insurance policy, so for 10 years, I’ve had the benefit of my entire cover paid to me without deduction tax. 

Saved me +40% all the way up. 

The advice therefore is to check your whether your employer is happy to arrange the policy is this way.

Happy to have offline chats if anyone wants…
[12/09/2025, 17:47:15] ~ William Nutting: On BMNR: Good luck, you can buy at 100+!
[12/09/2025, 17:54:09] ~ William Johnston: I think Tom Lee should stay in his lane. He is a great bull strategist, but he is a sell out when it comes to shitcoins. Frankly I have a pretty dim view of Ethereum which backs BMNR. I invested back in 2016. But a wallet got hacked in one of their smart contracts. The Ethereum foundation then forked the protocol to freeze out the hacked coins.  This is no different from a Central Bank controlling your money. Since then I have been 100% Bitcoin. Ethereum has since morphed into a proof of stake protocol like the rest of the shitcoins.  Proof of stake, as opposed to Bitcoin’s, proof of work favours the holders with the largest supply of coins. Bitcoin is a democracy of nodes. So whales have no influence.  Also Tom Lee was a supporter of a fork of Bitcoin, BSV that was created by the fraud Craig Wright who claimed to be Satoshi who had the book thrown at him by the UK law courts, and has since fled the county. Be careful out there. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/09/2025, 18:11:07] ~ KC Shetty: So, if not a ethereum bull, then not bullish on   BMNR too?
[12/09/2025, 18:20:36] ~ William Johnston: I am sure it will catch a bid in a bubble market.  But you have to get out before the top!  Frankly I only trust Bitcoin and that is my return benchmark. You might get lucky in shitcoins. I am not anti gambling, but I am no good at it. I think you can play the mo but don’t buy (only sell)when the RSI is >80 and bottom fish <40.  Also make sure you understand what you are investing in. These shitcoins may be the rails behind the Stablecoins, but there are  many competitors ie Tron, Solana, Ethereum etc. but the stablecoins will pick the shitcoin with the fastest speed and lowest fees (and little security). Also no supply limit.  The creators decide the supply as it goes along. No one knows how many Ethereum will ever exist as with other shitcoins. ‎<This message was edited>

[13/09/2025, 00:18:59] ~ KC Shetty: While all this Ionq news also helped, the fact is Riggetti also moved similarly. I believe it had all to do what Tom Lee said on cnbc today that the Oracle news with numbers into 2030 made it clear that the runway for AI was much clearer and it is under invested. Ionq and others in quantum area where they can process larger data more efficiently makes sense then. Imho of course.

[13/09/2025, 13:32:58] ~ Morgan: Hi William. Sorry to ask such I am sure a beginner's question but is the way to think about these two charts:
The fact that IT spending is continuing to increase in this cycle supports the ongoing rally, whereas back in 2001 the IT spending wasn't backing up the rally in share prices
[13/09/2025, 13:45:04] ~ William Johnston: The 2000 internet bubble was not driven by revenue/EPS, but eyeballs. The AI cycle is being driven by capex and revenue growth eg NVDA. More like the industrial revolution rather than building an Internet protocol which was more about copper wire and a market place. AI is about PhD level thinking machines and robots. ‎<This message was edited>
[13/09/2025, 14:21:35] ~ KC Shetty: @⁨~William Johnston⁩ has impressive credentials and I am not taking him head on but disagree with the hypothesis.  It is all post facto explanation.  I recall the 2000 mania when people compared it to previous Nifty 50 bubble. The logic of the bulls was the likes of Cisco was cheap and so the 40% dip in 2001 was to be bought.
[13/09/2025, 14:25:09] ~ KC Shetty: Post engineering,  MBA and cfa I started looking at charts and behavioural science, as in my initial 7 years in Indian markets,  between 1993 to 2000, markets would double and halve every 18 months. 

At the highs industrialists, global and local  institutional managers, analysts would be bullish and reverse at the lows. 

Anyways, not debating with anyone's logic , just my 2 pence, fwiw.
[13/09/2025, 14:27:26] ~ KC Shetty: If markets collapse now, it would seem logical that Google was making massive p/L expenses but conveniently only ammortising it on the balance sheet

[14/09/2025, 12:02:50] ~ Dipesh Patel: The idea, as you say, is you're buying before it turns. That turn can come from 
1) a reversal/less obvious headwind from Apple's move away from Qual (both the 17 and 17 pro use Qualcomm modems because they are much faster than Apple's own). Qualcomm has already guided to zero Apple modems from this year so headwind > tailwind 
2) a material shift in revs and profits from Qualcomm's position in autos which appears to be showing structural shifts. One theme I'm playing is that the cars of tomorrow are totally different eco systems. We've already started to see this but it may end up on steroids! London to Bristol driverless is a movie with surround sound or a whole office set up much more than today. All that connectivity is Qualcomm, Horizon Robotics (for ADAS) etc.
3) faster connectivity processing more AI, faster LLMs and related apps will all require faster leading modems = Qualcomm. 
It's cheap enough to take the risk IMO.

👉 Join our call with the CEO of *MilDef* this Friday at 13:00 (UK).

MilDef is Europe’s digital armor specialist—engineering rugged IT systems critical to modern military operations. As NATO allies escalate defense budgets and demand for battlefield digitalization surges, MilDef is perfectly positioned at the intersection of defense tech and tactical necessity. With rapid top-line growth, a record-breaking order book, and a disciplined M&A strategy, MilDef offers a compelling entry point into Europe’s high-growth defense digitization story.

Note we are speaking to the CEO the day after their CMD on 18th September where we are expecting to receive an impressive update to long-term guidance given strong order book development YTD… the event can be viewed via webcast - https://investors.mildef.com/investor-relations/kapitalmarknadsdag-2025/live-stream-cmd-2025/

This is a company we love - they have built a one-stop platform for over 800 artists who no longer need to sign to a major record label. At the heart is ATC’s management and live booking agency - to which they have added  events, merchandising and a direct-to-fan service. 

Mkt Cap of £15m v FY 2024 revs of £50.8m.
£9.66m of cash
Adj EBITDA £1.6m.

This is the cheapest way we can find to play what GS predict will be a double in global music revenues - to $200 billion - within the next decade. 

Adam is well worth meeting - so if you can be in the Cavendish Square area tomorrow or join virtually, we really would recommend it.

[15/09/2025, 20:09:16] ~ Ben Finegold: Spoke to Scott Melbye, Chairman of Uranium Producers of America who has been lobbying for this for some time.

Their main focus has been on: 

* Reducing reliance on Russia and China
* Expand the US Strategic Uranium Reserve not just for energy but defence
* Get uranium on the Critical Minerals list which brings with it expedited permitting and licensing 

Today’s announcement feels like a starter for ten and we expect more granular details to follow such as pricing, volumes, and which producers will be the beneficiaries of these deals.

It seems unlikely to us that UEC will not be at outsized winner in this space given their grip on permitted uranium assets, mills, and recently conversion. In 2022, UEC was paid >30% premium for lbs during Trump’s first $150m Strategic Reserve purchase. At the time, Trump recommended $1.5bn spent over 10 years on the Strategic Reserve, BUT that was before Trump’s stated goal of quadrupling nuclear power, and before we really started to see the AI power movement accelerate.

We would therefore expect to see at a minimum $1.5bn of announced purchasing by the US Government in follow up announcements. That would equate to ~20m lbs, less than half of what the US consumes on an annual basis. There is a high likelihood in our view that the programme could be more aggressive than that. 

UEC has pounded the drum on remaining unhedged and not selling lbs into the term market. While production ramp up remains in its infancy stage, the premium for US uranium is only increasing day-by-day. 

We will write up fuller thoughts as we get more details on the terms of this announcement but the sector has reacted positively with major names up 5-10%.

The other side of our business Curation Connect which is designed to promote the stories loved by our members is growing fast and we now hope to have 30-40 corporates signed by year end .

We are looking to hire a COO to help us manage the growth .  The candidate would be 28-35 with some sort of background in finance and it would be helpful if they had some previous experience in running a start up .

We are also looking for a generalist salesman / analyst to help us engage with more corporates , and ensure the content quality in the showcases are jargon free / simple to understand but of a high standard. 

Ai skills in both jobs are a requirement . 

If any of you wish to help or know someone that might suit please feel free to contact outside this group , 

Nick.finegold@curationcorp.com

In a few weeks the club site and shareflix will become one , 

Many thanks, 
Nick

[17/09/2025, 13:13:39] Nick finegold: For the Man Utd fans (and amused fans of every other club) you may be interested to note the US listed shares are being called down -12% pre market after publication of Q4 and FY results. Missed on revenue, EBITDA and bigger net loss than consensus. The owners may be  disinterested with results on the field but when it impacts the value of their shares the Galzers might wake up and do something about the manager? Guidance for year to June 26 is for flat EBITDA at best so even after the cost cutting means bigger all profits without European football

[17/09/2025, 14:41:10] ~ Jonny Haycock: June 18, 1815. The Battle of Waterloo.

Cannons thundered in Belgium. In London, traders held their breath.

If Napoleon won, British bonds would collapse. If Wellington won, they’d soar.

Legend says Nathan Rothschild had something no one else had:

A flock of carrier pigeons waiting on the battlefield.

While official couriers would take days, his birds flew through the night.

At dawn on June 19, a pigeon landed in London with a tiny message tied to its leg:

Wellington had won.

Rothschild rushed to the Exchange. But instead of buying, he began to sell.

Aggressively. Publicly. Relentlessly.

Panic spread. “If Rothschild is selling, Napoleon must have won.”

Prices collapsed as traders dumped their bonds in fear.

Only in the final moments did Rothschild signal his agents.

They bought everything at rock-bottom prices.

The next morning, the official news arrived: Wellington’s victory.

British bonds soared. Rothschild’s fortune soared with them.

Did it happen exactly this way? Historians debate it.

But the story survives because it reveals a truth bigger than the trade:

Markets aren’t just numbers on a screen.

They’re human emotion, compressed into prices.

Fear. Greed. Hope. Despair.

And the greatest fortunes in history weren’t built by chasing speed.

They were built by mastering patience.

By seeing through the fog of panic when everyone else is blind.

By remembering that chaos is temporary, but discipline compounds forever.

Rothschild’s pigeons are long gone.

But his lesson is eternal:

The strongest signal in markets isn’t in the data. It’s in human behavior.

And if you can stay calm when the world around you trembles, the future will always fly in your direction.

[18/09/2025, 06:10:16] Nick finegold: Evolv Meeting 
Takeaway

Maybe the hardest thing in investing is holding on to a stock that’s a true winner. 

Evolv’s management were deeply impressive, their execution since taking charge close to perfect — the team seem to  benchmark themselves against Axon, a hardware and software package that delivers unrelenting recurring revenues , I bought Axon 4 years ago its since gone up 3,000% and  I sold after it too had doubled.  I won’t be making the same mistake with Evolv .


Evlv doesn’t have the same moat but these are 4 year contracts with an intelligent software package attached. 

The lesson: conviction and patience matter most.

Evolv’s team estimates they’re in just 7,000 doorways out of 700,000—barely 1% penetration—so they’re creating an entirely new category rather than displacing incumbents. The addressable market is already vast, and likely understated. 

The real challenge for us as investors?

Simply holding on 

For disclosure Evlv as you know is by far my biggest personal position. ‎<This message was edited>

[18/09/2025, 07:04:29] Nick finegold: CoinShares – Crypto’s Best-Kept Secret

CoinShares might be one of the most under-appreciated plays in digital assets. With $10bn AUM and earnings of $150m+ annually, it’s already operating at scale. 

Yet, trading on just ~10× earnings, it remains hidden in plain sight.

With a US flotation via SPAC on the horizon. If it goes through, CoinShares could instantly become one of the most dependable, mainstream ways to get exposure to crypto markets.

I’ve  asked Raj at Stoic Point Capital to dig deeper into how the SPAC structure might take shape. He is a world expert on Spac structures and it’s not a very that they will end up with $600m of cash , not that it changes too much . 

We’ll update members once he’s spoken to the company. 

For now, this feels like a rare, overlooked opportunity first spotted by Jim Rutherford to whom I am deeply grateful . This stock is an example of the club working at its absolute best to find simple profitable overlooked opportunities hidden in plain sight .

[18/09/2025, 17:27:25] Calum Curation: Stumbled across UiPath yesterday and bought some for full disclosure. Think it could be a multi bagger in next 5 years.

They’re basically the leader in automation/RPA (robotics), now layering in AI so enterprises can run workflows with humans + bots + AI agents. Big trend behind them (everyone’s cutting costs, boosting productivity). Balance sheet is clean ($1.7bn cash, no debt) and they’re edging into positive cash flow. Stock’s already reset a lot – trades on ~4–5x sales vs 20x+ back in 2021.

Lots of near term catalysts:
	•	earnings beats (esp. ARR + margins),
	•	first signs of GAAP profitability,
	•	traction for their new AI/Autopilot features,
	•	and big contract wins (govt/enterprise).

They’ve got their FUSION event end of Sept + LTS release in Oct, so could be some product buzz too.

Blue sky is if growth re-accelerates and margins expand, this could be a $50–70bn company by 2030 (vs ~$6bn today).

To gain pure-play exposure to India’s technology sector, still underrepresented in global ETF offerings, investors can construct a targeted mini-basket of leading Indian IT firms. Key names include *Infosys (INFY)* and *Wipro (WIT)*, both of which trade as ADRs on U.S. exchanges, while #TataConsultancyServices (TCS.NS), #TechMahindra (TECHM.NS), and #HCLTechnologies (HCLTECH.NS) are accessible via Indian markets. Together, these firms represent the core of India’s globally competitive digital and software services industry, offering a passive yet precise entry point into the country’s tech ascent.

Not to say all companies that have crypto in their treasury are turds, there are a few miners (specifically those that are diverting their compute towards AI such as $IREN etc) that are interesting but companies with no business model aside from the mNAV arb is dangerous and at best wont outperform. $MSTR did well in the past as they were the only vehicle in town to get exposure to crypto in a tradfi way. The real killer for all these guys has been the ability to trade options on the IBIT. that started on November 19th which was literally the peak for $MSTR vs. BTC. All the other treasury companies have been terrible vehicles. Fundamentally i just dont see a reason to own these companies. There are some arguments around staking but these arguments will soon also disappear when the ETFs will be allowed to stake. Much more interesting ways to play the crypto theme in my option 🙂

*Collective Call - Curated: CoinShares*

📝 Strategic update as CoinShares scales its dual-revenue model and  for a Nasdaq US listing. One of the most under-appreciated plays in digital assets. With $10bn AUM and earnings of $150m+ annually, it’s already operating at scale. Trading on just ~10× earnings, it remains hidden in plain sight.

[19/09/2025, 17:00:30] ~ Matt H: A long AI query on silver. 
Bottom Line: SLV is experiencing an extreme shortage of borrowable shares due to a combination of high short interest, massive options expiry, and potential short squeeze conditions.
Key Factors Behind the Borrowable Share Shortage:
1. Dramatic Reduction in Available Shares
The number of SLV shares available for borrowing has plummeted from 10 million to a mere 10,000 in just two weeks, representing a 99.9% reduction The number of SLV shares available for borrowing has plummeted from 10 million to a mere 10,000 in just two weeks. This creates an extremely tight supply of shares available for short sellers to borrow.
2. Massive Options Expiry Pressure
A staggering 47,000 in-the-money (ITM) calls on the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) ETF are set to expire, representing a potential demand for 4.7 million shares The number of SLV shares available for borrowing has plummeted from 10 million to a mere 10,000 in just two weeks. With only 10,000 shares available to borrow, this creates a 470:1 imbalance between potential demand and available supply.
3. Skyrocketing Borrowing Costs
The borrowing fee for SLV has recently skyrocketed, increasing tenfold in a single day to reach 11.51% SubstackUSAGOLD. These extreme borrowing costs indicate severe market stress and supply shortages.
4. High Short Interest
The latest short interest data for the largest silver exchange traded fund (ETF) iShares Silver Trust 'SLV', holding 454 million (M) oz. of silver, are dated March 31, 2025 and show a growth of shorts now to 69.6M shares or 14% of the total 499M shares issued - the largest short interest in 2025 iShares SLV Silver ETF Short Interest Is Cooking Higher.
5. Physical Redemption Pressure
Investors appear to be redeeming SLV shares for physical silver at an accelerating rate, draining the ETF's liquidity while simultaneously driving up the cost of maintaining short positions Silver Squeeze Intensifies: SLV ETF Faces Physical Redemption Crisis As Borrowing Costs Soar To 11.5% - USAGOLD.
Market Implications:
The convergence of these factors - the large number of ITM calls expiring, the minimal shares available to borrow, and the soaring borrowing fees - suggests that silver shorts are indeed in a precarious position. The potential for a short squeeze has increased significantly, which could lead to rapid upward price movements in silver SubstackUSAGOLD.
This situation is creating what analysts describe as unprecedented stress as a drastic reduction in available shares for borrowing collides with surging demand for physical redemptions Silver Squeeze Intensifies: SLV ETF Faces Physical Redemption Crisis As Borrowing Costs Soar To 11.5% - USAGOLD, making it extremely difficult for short sellers to find shares to borrow for covering positions or establishing new short positions into expiry.

[19/09/2025, 20:19:25] ~ NH: I suspect silver will continue to have a strong run. It always lags gold by about 15-month and that about the time when gold really started to move… gold/silver is the one to watch - it’s at 85 (85 ounces of silver will buy you one ounce of gold) - it’s come down from 105 so silver has has started to catch up. But historically its been around 40-50 (if I’m not mistaken) so quite a bit to go. Big big psychological level for silver will be $50 per ounce which is all time peak of 1980. But inflation adjusted, that $50 45 yrs ago is like $145 today - lots of room to go, but probably has a pitstop at $50. But I like to play this theme via the miners - absolutely cash printing machines at the moment. YOLO on junior miners if you want real spicy stuff… 😂
[19/09/2025, 20:28:25] ~ Matt H: I think the ratio is 60 to 1. Never the less it’s still got a long way to catch up. Might be some resistance at $50 but at that price the miners will continue to rocket 🚀
[19/09/2025, 21:07:58] ~ Jonny Haycock: “global silver supply is now so tight that demand whether it be from investor or industrial sources is withdrawing market liquidity at an extraordinary rate”…….Macleod. Could get very lively now. The path to $50 silver and $4000 gold now seem in sight.

[20/09/2025, 09:01:04] ~ Jonny Haycock: If you want to get bullish, Inflation adjusted to get back to 1980 peak (which gold has now just surpassed) would require silver to hit $200…..
[20/09/2025, 09:01:38] ~ NH: Totally.
[20/09/2025, 09:10:28] Nick finegold: He is a master of story spinning . The reality is that barriers to autonomous driving at scaling is not really his technology but regulation , insurance , terrorism ( stick a bomb in an autonomous car ) do all Tesla’s have cameras inside ? Mine didn’t . So the idea that there will be an autonomous fleet of 10m driving around anytime in the next 5 years is a pipe dream.  

Whilst I think Musk is full of BS on timelines and numbers , I am just not prepared to fight millions of retail investors who buy into his narrative. Of millions of autonomous cars and millions of robots which one day will be true but not for a long time. ‎<This message was edited>

[20/09/2025, 13:11:30] ~ Simon Brewer: The gold bullion price has touched the US$3,700/oz level this week, above GREED & fear’s initial gold price target of US$3,400/oz set back in December 2002. The methodology of the target is to adjust the 1980 peak gold price of US$850/oz by the growth in US disposable personal income per capita which has occurred since January 1980.

Based on the latest data on US disposable income per capita, a price of US$6,600/oz is now a reasonable price target for gold at the peak of the current secular bull market. GREED & fear maintains the 40% weight in bullion in the global portfolio for a US dollar-denominated pension fund first set up at the end of 3Q02. That 40% weighting has been a minimum allocation to gold bullion ever since. Gold was reduced from 50% in December 2020 when GREED & fear first allocated an investment in Bitcoin in the same portfolio.

We are still Dancing hard, but I own boring cheap stuff too and I do my dancing knowing where the fire-exit is, and am staying selective.

AI & BUBBLES: of course Classic Economist! Owned by Grumpie old men and read by them. 
Honestly, the only thing more tedious than the endless chorus of “this can’t last” is the sheer confidence with which people who’ve been wrong for a decade keep repeating it. It’s like listening to your drunk uncle at Christmas misquote Churchill while spilling gravy down his tie. Markets don’t give a toss about your feelings, your faintly Marxist “valuations are stretched” mantra, or your half-remembered Economy 101 lectures. They care about capital flows, supply and demand, and who’s actually making money. The irony is that most of these doom-botherers have missed every rally since Netscape, spend their lives shorting Amazon in 1999, Bitcoin in 2014, and AI today and then wonder why nobody takes them seriously. The naysayer’s role in markets is a bit like a wasp at lunch outside: buzzing, unpleasant, occasionally stinging someone who deserves it  but mostly an irritant that everyone else wishes would sod off so we can enjoy the sunshine.
Consider this: in the dot-com era, the “ChatGPT moment” was Netscape in 1995. Five years later the bubble popped barely enough time to lay fibre, let alone build a flywheel. Now what? We’re now building off a mountain, not a molehill & oceans of data, industrial-scale compute, hyperscaler infrastructure. This isn’t Pets.com flogging dog food; it’s machines teaching machines at exponential pace. When a Tesla spots a kangaroo, within minutes every Tesla knows how kangaroos bounce. That’s not linear, it’s compounding. Eric Schmidt says AI is under hyped. Jensen Huang says demand is exponential. Safra Catz says it’s insatiable. (They would you say!) but yes Palantir reckons sales go up tenfold. Anthropic says compute doubles every six months. And that’s before computers start training computers. Expensive? Sure. A short-term top? Possibly. A bubble? Don’t be ridiculous. Calling this a bubble is like standing on the shoreline during the Industrial Revolution, sneering at steam engines because coal prices just went up. It’s not a fad this is the plumbing of the next century. If you want to use Golf club analogies ( the 3rd owner is the one who makes the money) probably thats where you should be.

[20/09/2025, 15:14:05] ~ William Nutting: Whats fascinating is Metals still tower in raw asset value gold’s a $16 trillion cathedral, silver another $1.5T. Crypto is the noisy neighbour at $2.5T, already 3x bigger than every listed gold and silver miner combined, but still a fraction of the underlying metal piles. In equities, it’s the other way round: miners dominate ($930B vs $150B in crypto names HOOD COIN etc).
[20/09/2025, 15:23:54] ~ Mark: Practical strategy of what hyperscalers actually do…
	•	Tier 1 (cutting-edge): newest GPUs for training + latency-critical or huge-context inference.
	•	Tier 2 (steady, high-volume inference): ASICs/custom parts where the perf/W delta ≥2× and the model/API is stable for 2–3 years.
	•	Tier 3 (long tail / batch / experiments): older GPUs until power or memory becomes the bottleneck; then retire or resell.

Obsolescence will depend a lot on perf/watt progression.

But I dont think anyone should be surprised if you find modern day cutting edge chips still work horsing away on Tail workloads in 7 years time.
[20/09/2025, 15:23:56] ~ Matt H: This is where I don’t know enough about crypto but gold miners produce something tangible which is sold to a refinery and at the moment there is an amazing margin. They create jobs and wealth. Crypto to me seems like it moves number around on a spreadsheet (blockchain) without really creating and jobs but it does create wealth as someone pays you more for it if it goes up. So do the crypto names make money by earning interest on people’s deposits or holding crypto and hoping it goes up? It’s a lot different that actually making something that sells for a margin.

Yes, all get similar charts now, yes the chart screams erosion, but context matters here. Stablecoins are still in their very first innings: we’ve honestly barely scratched the surface of global trade, on-chain treasuries, and tokenised bonds equities etc. Ethereum may have lost the easy retail transfers, but it’s digging in in trenches where the real money will flow; regulated stablecoins, institutional DeFi, RWAs, settlement layers built on L2s with compliance baked in. Sure, Solana and Tron win on speed and fees, but when the next wave is JPMorgan, BlackRock, and sovereign digital bonds, they’ll want Ethereum’s security, tooling, and institutional comfort. In other words: ETH has ceded some of the streets, but it’s still building the skyscrapers.

[22/09/2025, 10:57:56] Calum Curation: *Rainbow Rare Earths* is up 15% today (and +60% since our club call in July) after it reported further successful test work at its Phalaborwa project this morning. The team has now incorporated a cerium (Ce) depletion step, which improves the quality of the rare earth product while reducing costs and simplifying the separation process. This step has helped produce a high-purity mixed REE product, and the final separation circuit for NdPr and SEG+ (medium/heavy REEs including Dy and Tb) is on track to be finalised in Q4 2025.

*Why it matters*: Phalaborwa is already one of the highest-margin, lowest-cost, and most environmentally responsible REE projects. With scalable technology also being applied to Uberaba in Brazil, Rainbow is very well-positioned to supply critical rare earths for EVs, wind turbines, robotics, and defense applications.

[22/09/2025, 11:50:59] Calum Curation: Rainbow is smaller today than MP Materials but Rainbkw has higher purity and lower costs so it should be able to see faster revenue / margin growth per tonne. 

The flowsheet is modular so rainbow can add additional separation lines or replicate the process at other phosphogypsum sites. It’s already proven that it can scale beyond a single project with Uberaba (Brazil). There are lots of other phosphate producing regions so lots of further opportunities exist.

AVIO up another 7% today; now 3x from entry and still only  Eur 1.3bn! ( wrote up this morning).

JERSEY/ JOG LN: +14% 
as per this morning:
UK & NORTH SEA: I see a Miliband Fudge is being talked about: “Tie-Backs”. This is essentially allowing new exploration to adjacent fields, without breaking election pledge of no new drilling. So is a fudge. But good for growth!” 
WHAT LAST WEEK SHOULD HAVE CONFIRMED: If Britain is serious about AI, it needs serious energy. Training one GPT-4–class model eats >500 MWh (150 UK homes for a year). A hyperscale data centre draws as much power as a city of 200,000. Miliband’s Net Zero hair-shirt doesn’t square with that reality. North Sea output has halved since 2000, imports now cover >50% of UK gas, and new licensing barely registers (£1bn vs Norway’s $20bn+). AI only happens if the basin reopens. That’s why the best “what if” proxies are lining up: Jersey Oil & Gas (JOG), Kistos (KIST), Serica (SQZ), Hartshead (HHR), Ithaca (ITH), EnQuest (ENQ), Harbour Energy (HBR). These are all unloved, underpriced, and sitting on the very molecules that make the electrons that make the models run. If Starmer fires Miliband and re-licenses the rigs, these names simply go from optionality trades to core AI infrastructure. ‎<This message was edited>

A tentative start to see if it’s the right sort of idea to post….Desalination – demand for water in heat stressed areas well documented but historically unscalable due to cost (60% energy), limited tech advances and environment. Only real scale users Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Singapore. What’s changed? Energy costs: Solar energy costs have plummeted; significant technology advancements in reverse osmosis/electrodialysis and AI transforming delivery efficiency and environmental. Rapid acceleration in new demand from China, India, North Africa, Southern Europe and the US. Market expected to quadruple ($70bn) over the next 5 years. Just the start. No ETF play suggesting either theme not on radar screens or lack of obvious plays. Biggest players Veolia,Acciona BUT small part of their earnings. Purer plays: Consolidated water CWCO Energy Recovery ERII, Safbon Water Service 300262.SZ. Possible Israeli IPO IDE Technologies.Love to know if anyone else looked at it. Dominic

[23/09/2025, 08:19:08] ~ Robin Maxwell: Two German Mid Cap Names in Focus for me : Norma and Stabilus. I have been slowly building into two German Mid cap names Norma and Stabilus ...two former darlings that have both been hit hard since COVID given their Auto exposure. Stabilus is the significant global market leader in Gas Struts, and Powered motion and control systems. They have an extraordinary 80% market share in developed markets and pretty well every OEM worldwide is a customer. Its my way of playing a slow improvement in Autos. Norma needed to repair its balance sheet and has just sold its US water and irrigation system for a much higher price (2 x sales €620m cash inflow) than I think market thought it would get) This is a watershed for a global leader in connection systems (Norma clip aka Jubilee clip) and a recent large order and new exposure to Datacentres (Malaysia order from US customer). Busy two days ahead for me - more on this later in the week.

“The deal marks a “new financing model . . . where we can pay over time, instead of buying them up front”, he added. “The chips and the systems are a humungous [percentage] of the cost and it’s hard to pay that upfront.”

Sam Altman 

My personal view is we are clearly not running out of demand for chips,  we just might be running out of ways to pay for them .  A downturn in ad revenues , or any slowdown in the hyperscalers business models would lead to huge problems. 

I would welcome the clubs thoughts in this deal.

In Nutstuff today I try to do a good Geo-Political go through on Trump from yday at UN. A think piece on Tether and stable-coins and a devils advocate on everyone praying for a coming UK gilts debacle. Nutstuff is finding ever more micro-caps to buy. 

On Uranium, as ever Team OW are on it, but on ORKLO etc

NUCLEAR HAS ITS “MEME MOMENT”: 
Oklo, $20.7bn ! with no revenue, no NRC license, and a rejected 1.5 MWe design, now trades at a fatter valuation than BWXT, Curtiss-Wright, or AtkinsRéalis companies that actually build and service reactors, sell isotopes, or engineer infrastructure worldwide. It’s arguably a “Theranos-with-fuel-rods” story: glossy renderings and Silicon Valley swagger being priced as if sodium fast reactors were already commercial, when even Rosatom struggles with them at scale. Meanwhile, the real value sits with the incumbents and the fuel chain: BWXT making sub cores, UEC pushing U.S. supply, URNM indexing the cycle, ASPI and LTBR riding the technology and enrichment angles. Oklo’s hype will collapse under the weight of licensing and physics, but the capital rotation it represents nuclear’s “meme moment” and arguably only drives more attention and eventual flows into the companies with actual kilowatts, customers, and cash flow. Silex has a mkt cap of $1.1bn and owns 51% of GLE which will make LEU. Cameco will likely exercise its option to buy another 25% of GLE from Silex. LTBR has a mkt cap of “only” $540m. 
Ocean Wall reminded me yesterday that ASPI’s mkt cap is $1bn for: 
1. HALEU producer - likely 3 sites in 3 countries - GLE has only one site in North Carolina - Paducah
2. Silicon 28 - 80kg of capacity and rising - for next gen semis.
3. ⁠Yttebium 176 for cancer drugs - massive shortage.
4. ⁠Carbon 12 and 14 for imaging and electronic warfare. 
5. ⁠Lithium 6 and 7 for various nuclear processes. 
6. ⁠Pet Labs - radio pharmacy using cyclotrons to 10x EBITDA.
7. ⁠Renergen: ASPI is buying the best helium asset in the world for cents in the $.
Oh; can we talk about Amarillo Texas yet?!!!

Reminder of Nutstuff New URANIUM “Special-sit” name: Aura Energy/ AURA LN. A micro‑cap uranium play with mega upside. It’s sailing under the radar at just $120 million USD market cap basically pocket change next to miners like Cameco ($32 billion), Kazatomprom ($14 billion), and Uranium Energy ($4.9 billion). That makes Aura a 20x+ upside candidate if it executes on Tiris and Häggån. projects backed by offtakes, institutional backing (47%), and imminent permitting wins. Yes it’s loss-making and early‑stage, but that’s expected in a pre‑production junior. In short: while big names move in slow, Aura is the nimble, cheap pick with leverage to a uranium price surge and the nuclear renaissance. ‎<This message was edited>

[24/09/2025, 23:20:14] ~ William Nutting: Nick thx…
You are too kind!


Barack Obama at the O₂ was frankly the perfect metaphor for his presidency: beautiful packaging, zero payload. Ninety minutes of civilised waffle, as smooth as a hotel lobby piano, and just as forgettable. Not a spark, not a namecheck for Trump, not even the suggestion that the world is now tearing itself apart on the fault lines of the very order he supposedly “led.”
This is the man who promised change and delivered managerialism. Who spoke of hope while presiding over drone wars, hollowed-out institutions, and a global system so fragile that it cracked the moment he left office. Obama’s “new world order” was a PowerPoint fantasy that left America paralysed and its enemies emboldened. He mistook eloquence for strategy, optics for outcomes. The result? The revenge of the colonised, the rise of the oppressed , the return of hard men with harder armies.
The oppressed are not rising because they were inspired by Obama’s America. They are rising because they saw its emptiness the carefully balanced speeches, the risk-averse half-measures, the absence of will. The empire didn’t fall to force; it sighed itself into irrelevance.
And here he is, in London, reduced to after-dinner speaking for the devout, a travelling salesman for a memoir, still too cautious to even utter his nemesis’s name. Obama is not a fighter. He never was. He was the usher at history’s funeral, and he still doesn’t know it.

He certainly did mention the world taring itself apart but was careful to make sure that he said it was by no means exclusive to the USA and coming to a cinema near you soon . We move on x

[26/09/2025, 08:33:50] ~ William Nutting: Exactly!
From todays Nutstuff on UEC..
And exactly the point we discussed at OW hosting ASPI. 

URANIUM/ UEC: was a $3.50 entry for Nutstuff vs $13.40 today, and have never waivered on my Uranium conviction for 3+ years! ( but was grim for al long time!) 
UEC is still not a “mine today” story, it’s a leveraged call option on U.S. nuclear security policy + $100 uranium. The patient strategy (no sub-$80 contracts, slow ramp) looks prescient. With the U.S. government explicitly signalling it will treat uranium like rare earths, strategic, subsidised, stockpiled. UEC is the liquid vehicle. You buy it for the day Washington writes a floor price under the market and utilities scramble to secure domestic supply. The last 3 years have been a 4x rerate the next 3 could rhyme if uranium goes where it always does in a tight cycle: way higher than anyone thinks. At $6bn this has quietly become the best-positioned U.S. ISR producer: Texas, Wyoming, Saskatchewan all underpinned by a balance sheet with $271m cash/ATM and no debt. The strategy has been simple but shrewd: no long-term contracts, no need to buy pounds in the market, maximum leverage to spot. I see a path to $25+. On NAV sensitivity: $60/lb = $11/sh, $100/lb = $18.50/sh.
[26/09/2025, 08:35:50] Nick finegold: Intel is a lot rarer than uranium miners  . Ditto Samsung . These foundries simply must succeed . ‎<This message was edited>

[26/09/2025, 08:37:23] ~ William Nutting: And to yours and my agreement on any portfolio core must own of GOOGL..

 GOOGL & BITCOIN MINERS: For years Bitcoin miners were the energy world’s orphans condemned to hunt stranded megawatts, finance on junk terms, and dump their own coins just to stay solvent. Their competitive edge was never the coins, but the infrastructure: knowing where to plant a 100MW shed, how to strip cooling costs to the bone, how to arbitrage grid volatility.  Now Google has validated that edge with hard cash. 	
•Cipher Mining: a 10-year, 168MW hosting deal worth ~$3B. Google is on the hook for $1.4B of obligations and walks away with warrants for ~5.4% equity. 	
•: circling ~$3B in financing for new compute campuses, again with Google’s backing.  
This is strategic, not opportunistic. Hyperscalers are realising that the path to scaling AI infrastructure is not just more GPUs, it’s energy arbitrage exactly the miner’s trade. The boundary between “mining” and “AI data-centres” is disappearing.  For miners, it flips the model: Contracted revenues (AI hosting) alongside volatile block rewards. Access to capital via investment-grade counterparty guarantees, rather than death-spiral equity raises. Load balancing between cycles, Bitcoin halving seasons metered with AI training bursts. It also highlights the paradox: both AI and Bitcoin are born of the same parent, the high-density compute warehouse, yet they represent opposite economics. AI is infinite output, lowering the marginal cost of intelligence to zero. Bitcoin is absolute scarcity, a hard cap on digital money. Both feed on the same turbines and cooling rigs, but one floods while the other withholds. The endgame is obvious: miners and AI operators merge into energy-arbitrage landlords, owning the cheapest megawatts and renting them out in whatever form the market demands. GPU cycles or SHA-256 hashes. Google’s billions are the tell. Whoever controls the low-cost energy campuses won’t just be running miners or AI labs; they’ll be running the backbone of digital abundance and digital scarcity simultaneously.

[27/09/2025, 09:39:07] ~ William Nutting: ELECTRONIC ARTS $50bn LBO/ take private!
A glance at a longer term px chart and you can see EA has spent a long time treading water. In a world of trillion $ companies, If EA really goes at $50bn yes it’s the mother of all LBOs, but is hardly another top of the market sign IMHO. More a sign again of the magnitude of flows and money chasing returns. Yes,  the maths likely only works if you believe video games are the next toll road of digital media. Live-services, Ultimate Team, Sims packs: they throw off subscription-like cash flows that PE can lever to the hilt, then flip back to the market once the multiple resets. At 22× EV/EBITDA you’re paying Netflix-style multiples for NFL-franchise stickiness, and that makes sense when Roblox is still a $30bn meme platform on barely $750m of EBITDA, or Take-Two trades at $20bn on GTA hype alone. Microsoft had to cough up $69bn for Activision, Sony’s a $100bn media-hardware hybrid, Nintendo $70bn for Mario + Zelda IP. Against that backdrop, $50bn for FIFA, Madden, Apex and Sims is less mad than it initially looks, it’s maybe PE’s way of simply buying the next Hollywood+NFL bundle before Wall Street remembers it’s growth, not value.
To be clear, this is NOT for me. In a DeFi/DePIN gaming world, EA and TTWO only win if they pivot from rent-takers to protocol owners. Their IP is gold: FIFA, Madden, GTA, but blockchain rails strip out the toll booths and hand the power to players. Either they tokenise and control the new pipes, or they end up like Blockbuster watching the streaming era roll past. Fascinated to watch how this unfolds.

_*October aka shutdown season is lining up to be stellar!*_

- Fed blindfolded by shutdown → Data drought = more excuses to cut. Jefferson already flagging labour risks.
- Labour market cracking → JOLTS quits & hires rolling over, ADP risk today.
- Yields set to puke → FI bid building, avoid Value traps, momentum plays win.
- Dollar wreckage → DXY down -12% YTD, still can’t bounce. If $ falls further → global M supply (ATH $114T) expands, rocket fuel for risk.
- Trump twist → Job cuts over furloughs, unemployment perception worsens, Fed gets spooked. Gold reval + stealth QE? Not impossible.
- ⁠Add Q4 seasonality (historically strongest risk quarter) and you’ve got momentum tailwinds galore.

_…However, for TSMC, the local shares often lag during speculative US market rallies, with ADRs sometimes staying at an unusually high premium for extended periods. In these situations, locals typically catch up when attention shifts or arbitrage becomes more feasible, but regulatory inefficiencies mean ADRs can retain an outsized premium for months or years…_ ‎<This message was edited>

Nike is stuck in a wholesale bloat and with fading innovation. You pay a premium multiple for On because it’s the Tesla-vs-GM moment in shoes: the growth vector is pretty obvious.

[01/10/2025, 08:32:45] ~ Robin Maxwell: (Bloomberg) -- Pfizer Inc. secured a reprieve from President Donald Trump’s long-threatened tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry Tuesday by agreeing to slash some of its drug prices by up to 85% and selling directly to the American public, a move other major drugmakers are expected to follow.

Healthcare stocks flying this am after Pfizer said it will ensure Americans receive comparable prices to those offered in other countries and will launch new medicines at parity, addressing a key Trump complaint that Americans unfairly shoulder the highest medical costs in the world. In exchange, the company gained a three-year grace period from widely anticipated pharmaceutical tariffs that the administration has been promulgating.

[01/10/2025, 13:17:02] ~ William Johnston: As a portfolio manage for over 3 decades I find these conclusions fascinating.  Also how badly investors are served by the asset management industry.  I consider the 60:40 portfolio is dead. 40% invested in bonds is wealth destruction. You have to be very careful with your equity selection since the odds you picking a great stock are not great.  My conclusion is concentrate on investments with transformative, scalable, and network effect technologies that create asymmetric growth opportunities. 

Here’s a five-bullet-point summary of the key findings from Hendrik Bessembinder’s "Shareholder Wealth Enhancement, 1926 to 2022":

- **Extreme Skewness in Returns**: The top 4% of U.S. stocks (approximately 1,000 firms) accounted for the entire net wealth creation in the stock market from 1926 to 2022, while the remaining 96% collectively matched or underperformed one-month Treasury bills.
- **Wealth Concentration**: Just 0.25% of stocks (about 64 firms) generated over half of the total market’s wealth, highlighting the dominance of a few "superstocks" like major tech firms.
- **Underperformance of Most Stocks**: Approximately 58% of individual stocks failed to outperform one-month Treasury bills over their lifetimes, indicating that most stocks do not contribute to positive equity index performance.
- **Consistency Over Time**: The findings hold across subperiods, with the top-performing stocks consistently driving market returns, regardless of economic conditions or market cycles.
- **Global Applicability**: The updated analysis confirms similar patterns in global markets, where the top 2.4% of firms drove all net wealth creation over three decades, emphasizing the universal nature of this skewness.

I love a dead-mans cardiogram! 
This: https://x.com/ftr_investors/status/1973357887281037767?s=46
At $7, Peloton was trading like a busted fad, priced for bankruptcy with negative sentiment maxed out. But underneath, the pieces of a turnaround were to me visible: a sticky subscription base that still pays every month, a cult brand with global resonance, and hardware that can be reinvented rather than scrapped. The bear case was fully in the price. The bull case was asymmetric: if management delivered even modest wins it is palpable with price hikes, refreshed hardware, commercial partnerships, or AI-driven training , the equity had / has leverage. That’s exactly what’s happening now. Short interest near 20% just adds fuel. At $7, Peloton was less a broken bike company and more a deeply out-of-the-money call option on a health and wellness platform, simple and cheap optionality in a market that usually overpays for growth.( see NIKE!)

New management and capex cycle to normalise down. Old growth targets were obvs bs but on 14x (FTSE c 12x) with 4.4% yield and performance pretty good within their categories for a global leader in what  is humanity’s oldest manufacturing industry producing the drug of choice of the last 5000 years I find interesting.

[01/10/2025, 19:03:21] Nick finegold: It’s undoubtedly been one our worst stocks and I think it’s related to sentiment around rates coming down and being a headwind . 

It’s a predominantly agency business I am certain it’s cheap , but they make a lot of money from customer deposits and that my best guess unless I find out something new . 

For what it’s worth from the work I did before . I think rates would have to drop below 3.5% before eating into margins. Also I believe that an increase in customer deposits would partially offset that . 

It’s probably a wonderful entry point and I would be surprised if the founders would sell stock down here , and the commodities super cycle shows no sign of abating , however it’s not been good and I appreciate you pointing it out best Nick

Two of my backbone SIPP positions are heavily exposed to Tesco.

-The s4 for its combination with HCM II (ticker HOND) went effective sept 26.

ROE is fantastic, and growth used to be double digit. The key question is whether the current growth pause - that tanked the stock - is temporary.  In the meantime the company turns almost all of its earnings into FCF, which mostly get distributed as dvd. So while the recurring dvd yld is only 5.7% it usually gets supplemented with a special that is larger than the recurring one. A return to growth , which is quite possible would rerate the stock.

I am familiar with DeMark and also observe the signals from Parallax Financial Research which examines the Hurst exponent of a time series to judge how non-random the trend is in historical context.  The further it moves away from a random walk and commences a trend there comes a point where the probability of further gains become minimal as it is so "extended".  This measure, describes the degree of extension. (Apologies for the nerdy explanation). As of yesterday, both gold and silver have achieved equivalent levels to the 1999 Nasdaq top.  
It is noteworthy also that, typical of a top, intraday volatility is growing (eg silver today) and of course, many brokers are competing with each other to raise their price targets.

On the debt I couldn’t work out how sensitive they are to near term rates, but 4% average? A lot of debt, but they could in theory sell the Indian business for $12bn (they own 60%) and the gbp headwinds should abate? Any insights on US inventory issues on don julio? Noted it’s half the multiple of its average with guiness kicking the lights out. I’m interested to see what they sell off as non core, and how much cost they can pull out, lastly on management who can pull it around?

[03/10/2025, 14:54:32] ~ David Haysey: Hi Andrew,
To take your points in reverse order.
GLPs etc. The Bytetree piece covered some of this in more detail but obvs must b some effect recently within the v long term DM trend of falling alcohol consumption on a volume basis. Interestingly was some work from Jefferys recently suggesting wine falling worse than spirits/beer. Might be GLP specific as wine commonly drunk with food?
Also youth seem to favour beer and spirits. Is clear DGE doing well within its particular categories, but equally the 5-7% (abandoned) sales growth target unrealistic.
Debt is complex. Co accounts in $ but borrows in array of currencies. Overwhelmingly fixed rate. At year end (June) $24bn debt o/w $2.9 due within one year. Thereafter repayment cadence pretty even with no big cliff maturities. Effective interest rate 4.1% so your number looks fair. 
On divi paid $2.3bn last FY. Accounting net was $2.5bn.FCF $2.7bn. Unsurprisingly they stopped the buyback program which was $1bn and $1.6bn in the two prior years. 
I think in general there’s been a tendency in the staples sector to grow divis at rates that aren’t perhaps justified by top line growth as currently observed. 
Not sure about CEO search but think Nik the acting one gave pretty good account of self on last earnings call. 
If can bring capex back to historic levels and sell some non-core stuff at good prices think could rerate quite quickly.

[04/10/2025, 06:07:44] ~ TimB: The market-cap leader never really went anywhere, but it’s broken out of the range it’s been stuck in for the last few months and is trading back above $120,000. Bitcoin is up almost 10% over seven days and 8% over the last month. Ethereum and others have followed, trading roughly along the same path. Some say the rally’s due to seasonal optimism, others suggest that current macro uncertainty is leading investors to hedge through Bitcoin, while some point to a potential Fed rate cut at the end of the month.

The pulse in crypto markets has pushed the Fear and Greed Index to the brink of Neutral and Greed, while the average crypto Relative Strength Index reflects the current drive by slipping into overbought territory. US spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in about $675.8 million on Wednesday, the highest since mid-September.

[06/10/2025, 08:12:50] ~ Matt H: Chief Investment Officer, Mike Wilson, recommends shifting from the traditional 60/40 equity-bond portfolio to a 60/20/20 allocation: 60% equities, 20% fixed income (bonds), and 20% gold. This is positioned as a stronger hedge against inflation in the current environment, where U.S. equities offer limited upside relative to Treasuries and bond yields are elevated.
Wilson explains: “Gold is now the anti-fragile asset to own, rather than Treasuries. High-quality equities and gold are the best hedges.” He emphasizes gold’s role as a safe-haven asset that performs well when real rates fall during downturns, complementing equities’ growth-linked inflation protection

[06/10/2025, 11:54:56] Calum Curation: If people are interested in a fascinating special-sit in the bitcoin space then worth looking at Semler Scientific. Semler is a Bitcoin treasury company with a small healthcare business on the side. Two weeks ago when its share price was $29 it was acquired by Strive for a “200%+ premium at c$90/share”. Today you can buy Semler shares for $30.50. Why haven’t the shares gone up? Well the deal was all paper. Strive offered 21.05 Strive shares per Semler share when strive was trading on $4.3. It seems like a massive premium but Strive bitcoin per share actually rises as it effectively bought Semler at a discount to its bitcoin MNAV using Strive shares valued at its own MNAV.

Fast forward to today and Strive is trading at $2.65. If the merger goes ahead then Semler shareholders will get 21.05x2.66 which equals $56. Nearly 100% upside from the current share price of $30… both companies want to push this through quickly so hopefully it’s all done by January. Doing some research it seems likely to go through and if it doesn’t then Strive owes Semler $50m which is a lot for a $300m mkt cap company….the risk arb on this is crazy. 

If you look to value the merged company…they will hold 10,800 Bitcoin. At the current price this is nearly $1.5/share. Strive also owns a rapidly growing asset mgmt business with $2bn of AuM. They also own a social media division and Semler’s healthcare business (which they will look to offload or monetise). Given its scale (Michael Saylor said last week he thinks strive is one of the best Bitcoin treasury company which could 100x) then some sort of premium is justified. Even with no premium though as a worst case scenario then it’s worth $1.8. This is $38 per Semler shares which is nearly 30% upside. 

But strive is currently on $2.6. If bitcoin keeps rising as MSTR keeps its breakout momentum I think there’s every chance Strive shares are $3-3.5+ when the merger closes in 3 months which is $63-73 per Semler shares vs $30 today. Given Strive was trading on $12 a few weeks ago the blue sky for holding Semler today is clearly materially higher (5-10x bagger). I might be missing something but the risk / reward seems incredible. 
Full disclose I hold a fair few Semler shares.

[06/10/2025, 12:14:23] ~ Bram Cornelisse: It is very very expensive to short Strive, and the market probably expects the stock to collapse when the deal closes ( strive put options, strike $2.50, cost $1.50 for march). Not expressing a view here on the value of the merged company, just saying that the option market is indicating that the Strive price is a bit suspicious.
[06/10/2025, 14:50:30] ~ William Nutting: Sorry, a wry Nutstuff smile as the GOM’s ( Grumpie Old Men) are all sneering again; its the the usual chorus of grey-templed cynics wheezing about “AI bubbles” and “AMD overpaying for compute,” as if they’ve just discovered valuation discipline after a decade of buying artisnal coffee & SPACs. Of course there is the ever more predictable blab of this being the paying of an ever larger Mastercard bill with your Visa-card, sure it sounds cute and catchy, but it totally misses the point: we’re not in the phase where logic dictates, we’re in the phase where infrastructure gets built regardless of cost. WTFU, these are not just tech trades anymore, they’re industrial policy trades. Washington, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and half of Asia have decided AI is the new electricity and when governments decide something is the new electricity, they don’t ask what the multiple is. They pour concrete, lay cables, and buy every GPU they can get their hands on. Energy is money and the thing about every great industrial build-out; railways, fiber, AI compute is that it doesn’t just create winners, it actually debases the denominator. Governments and corporates borrow, print, and simply subsidise the future into existence. In that sort of environment, the currency stops being a store of value and starts being a coupon for participation. 
Nutstuff is happy to dance hard but absolutely near the fire exit but I am firmly positioned that for the next few months maybe even quarters this mania continues to fund itself. Each chip order begets another data-centre tender, another power-contract signing, another sovereign AI fund, and the feedback loop hums on. So yes, maybe AMD is buying compute with compute but honestly so what? In 1840 people said the rail barons were “laying track to nowhere.” By 1850 they were running the economy. The old men in their value fcf & dividend cardigans can mutter about tulips and valuation discipline all they like but they will bleed assets here IMHO, and they’ll still be paying 20% more for the same stock when they finally admit it’s not a bubble, it’s a build-out. So, no, AI isn’t your Visa card, it is actually the payments network and the next few months are when the concrete gets poured.  Nutstuff is staying long the mania until I see signs of the the music stopping. 
Bitcoin remains my largest Portfolio posn. Yes, I know I am dull. ( we have NBIS & GOOGL and some Semis and loads of Uranium) my “value” remains in commodities Energy and Uranium/ Nuclear.

A senior PM at a major private equity firm involved in data centre real estate asked me an interesting question about Google: What happens if your Gmail suddenly costs £50 a month? Or your Apple subscription quadruples?

The point was that the price inelasticity of these digital services has never truly been tested — especially as core user functions become more deeply integrated with AI. Their view is that there’s still substantial headroom for the hyperscalers to increase infrastructure spending and expand earnings in parallel.
[06/10/2025, 17:27:12] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Hmmm I doubt that, email hosting is pretty low barrier to entry so there will be plenty of competition quite quickly. Switching costs etc of course but I doubt Google would like 90% of their users to migrate away. The assumption that bundled services would remain bundled under cost increase is questionable at best.

1/ Who has been selling it ? For the last year I have heard people talk about how BTC is going to double ( again I have been one of them ) it hasn’t happened yet the volatility has gone away , it’s volatility that the treasury companies have been selling . How will all these people selling BTC at a premium end up ? 

2/ Tell me about why BTC can’t be hacked .  Tell me about the security around it and the protocols that protect it . 

Give me a more balanced narrative .

To be clear , I am long , I believe , I deeply appreciate all of your insights I really am  , but I want to know what I don’t know not what I do know. 

If I was Putin . I would spend my whole day wanting to hack BTC as Trump champions it ?

Bitcoin’s not dead it’s just simply digesting its believers. The sellers aren’t traitors, they’re accountants cashing in before the next mania. Volatility hasn’t died, it’s simply crouching.

You can’t hack Bitcoin because it isn’t a thing it’s maths with muscle. To break it, you’d need to out-compute the planet and Putin can’t nuke a hash rate and he now knows that and is why he waves the flag. 

Bitcoin is the only asset that fights back when attacked, its the cockroach of finance, immune to governments, inflation, and human stupidity.

[06/10/2025, 18:08:05] ~ NH: each of your questions could fill out en entire book but at a high level these are my thoughts: 

1. Recent sellers: There have been quite a few long time dormant accounts (BTC wallets that have been inactive for +10-12 yrs) that have woken up in the last few weeks and started selling. Probably monetising positions that are up several 1000%. 
2. Theoretically you could do a 51% attack which means you’d control over 50% of BTCs hashing power and control the system that checks and secures the entire blockchain. If you were able to do that, you could double spend, alter transaction history, block other miners from adding blocks etc. There have been multiple attempts to estimate the cost of doing such an attack and given the computational intensity of such an undertaking, it is estimated that such an attack would cost multiple billions. However, the flip slide of this, if someone ever managed to do it, they would have control over a digital asset who’s value would instantly collapse to zero as thats one of BTC’s major USPs - so not really a good ROIC… Putin’s time probably best spent doing other stuff TBH…
[06/10/2025, 18:12:19] ~ William Johnston: This is best served with a zoom call. You need to understand cryptography (SHA256 snd ECC) and how the Bitcoin address structure works.  Simply you have a Public Key address which is linked to a Private Key. The address is a 256 bit number which there are more than atoms in the universe.  The chance of you guessing that number or Putin is kind of impossible. On the flow of funds please see my post at the weekend on money flow. Essentially there have been large whales selling. Looks like the flow is now positive. ‎<This message was edited>

It is a threat, but there are ways to adapt the protocol to migrate keys to Quantum resistant addresses.  There is also a great deal of misinformation on this.  Quantum is a threat to all computer security, not just Bitcoin. Banks, energy grids and nuclear codes. Bitcoins address system is less vulnerable that altcoins such as Ethereum etc.

Should we have a separate crypto chat group ?
‎OPTION: Yes (11 votes)

[06/10/2025, 18:54:43] ~ Matt H: I think being bullish an underlying asset class is healthy discussion. The key is to find the leveraged equity names that will outperform the underlying asset class. There is no point in being long gold when you can buy gold miners. There is no point buying uranium when you can buy leveraged uranium miners. Same with bitcoin. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/10/2025, 18:54:51] ~ William Nutting: I think segregating is exactly the issue we frankly need to move on from. Gold separate? Commodities separate? 
As long as we keep the Digital assets chat simple and  understandable better surely all together especially as tokenisation etc all becomes more mainstream and now  buyable by retail… ‎<This message was edited>
[06/10/2025, 18:55:28] Nick finegold: I think that’s a super interesting point
[06/10/2025, 18:57:17] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Matter of proportion. Happy for both but if crypto becomes 75% of the content, separate is better.
[06/10/2025, 18:59:13] ~ William Nutting: How about a separate chat strictly for digital asset geeks and then for those who are digital asset engaged ; WE undertake to be more selective and not bore or “nerd out” the wider group?

[06/10/2025, 19:13:11] ~ Charlie Morris: So long as it’s relevant, like it is today, no need. Shut up the bitcoin bros if they become boring in the next bear market
[06/10/2025, 19:13:41] ~ NH: Beg to differ on that one. “Not your keys, not your coins” as they say in cryptoland…  the whole point of crypto is about self custody. Buying a leveraged crypto vehicle (such as treasury company) in my view is completely useless and defines the whole point crypto as you introduce a third party again (managment team) that you need to trust… crypto doesn’t have a good track record when third parties are involved (Luna, FDX etc…)

Coinshare or Coinbase or others? 
A bit of an open question …. Please keep it simple …. Thank you. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/10/2025, 19:25:28] ~ William Johnston: Bitcoin. I only owned Bitcoin related equity because the FCA banned buying the ETNs in my SIPP and ISA. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/10/2025, 19:27:50] Adam Clib: So assuming you can buy the bitcoin Swedish etf in your SIPP …. (Which you can) 
You would rather own that over the equity names ….?
[06/10/2025, 19:31:59] ~ NH: Depends I think. Playing a coinbase is essentially a general adoption play. Buying an Individual coin is a call on a specific protocol. I would do both. I would never buy a treasure company though as that’s just a grift IMO.
[06/10/2025, 19:32:14] ~ William Nutting: Am No guhru but…
IMHO: Owning the coins is pure is like holding gold bars in a world of ETFs and IOUs. No counterparty, no CEO, no earnings call. That purity cuts both ways: no yield, no moat, no customer base but if a Bitcoin winter again, your wallet becomes grim. Coinbase, Robinhood, CoinShares they’re picks and shovels on the digital gold rush, great if you want leverage, liquidity, and lawsuits. Think 1bn digital wallets hungry to play. They clip the ticket whether BTC’s at $20k or $200k. But they’re also just regulated toll booths so are vulnerable to the same bureaucrats Bitcoin was invented to dodge. It is still so early I’d own most in the cathedral ! But own the bazaar and the rave ( ETH & Solana). And punt something in levered equity plays.
[06/10/2025, 19:33:02] ~ William Johnston: I will own Bitcoin proxies in a tax sheltered account since I can’t own Bitcoin direct.  But the real innovation is self custody ie no third party liability. I bought MSTR in 2020 and it beat Bitcoin.  But I got lucky.
‎[06/10/2025, 19:35:02] ~ William Johnston: ‎image omitted
[06/10/2025, 19:36:18] Adam Clib: Ty both.
[06/10/2025, 19:54:21] ~ NH: Indeed MSTR has been very impressive but for me they are just savy financial engineers. It worked well as they offered investors that didn’t have the ability to gain exposure to BTC in a very friendly wrapper. I just don’t see why, now with ETFs and options anyone would ever buy MSTR?? The market is saying the same thing with the mNAV having compressed from 3.4x to current 1.6x. Interestingly options on the IBIT were introduced on the 19th of Nov 2024, MSTR mNAV peaked on the 20th! Coincidence?? 😆 I’m totally open to being convinced otherwise but for now, I don’t see how any of these companies generate any value (aside maybe for their managment teams)…
[06/10/2025, 19:55:16] ~ Matt H: Sounds like a Jane Street Short
[06/10/2025, 20:02:40] Calum Curation: I suppose an opposing argument would be that even if Strategy share price fell all the way to its MNAV tomorrow (222p) it would have still outperformed Bitcoin since the day it announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy in August 2020 (18x vs 10.5x).
[06/10/2025, 20:03:11] ~ Rachid: Totally right. I would add that MSTR smartly applied the convertible strategy by selling their own volatility when it was around 120% implied at an attractive discount hence the huge demand. With BTC volatility collapsing (and MSTR’s as a result) they can no longer afford such a discount to attract investors
[06/10/2025, 20:04:03] ~ Dipesh Patel: I would add that in a world of social media, momentum, fomo and a relatively unregulated asset/adjacent assets, many things are unpoliced. In particular, the narrative. When you read the last results release of MSTR, you really have to read it again and again to think are they really allowed to say/claim some of what they do. I'm not a hater of crypto and I do trade the names occasionally. I own coinbase atm, but some of the stuff going on is seriously nuts. I'd agree with Matt as well that you don't have to play the space for huge upside. Infact even outside Allied Gold, a lot of names mentioned on this chat are up 2x +. My view on the separate chat would be ideally not. You dont have to read the last 52 posts😉. There will also be some convergence with other things on the chat. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/10/2025, 20:10:57] ~ NH: 💯 agree that they have done a stellar job in delivering value in the past as they where the only dealer in town give access to an in demand drug. My only point is that going forward, there ‘raison d’être’ is no longer obvious to me as the market  has changed and the market doesn’t need what they offer (BTC access) and there are more efficient vehicles for that. ‎<This message was edited>

[06/10/2025, 20:15:06] Calum Curation: I think you’re completely right and in a rational market the mnav premia would likely shrink to zero in the coming months. But we are very much in an irrational / bubble territory fuelled by rapidly expanding liquidity. So if we think that the bubble / bull market continuities for another 2 years, and that Bitcoin hits $250k + in the next two years then I would bet a lot on treasury companies producing hugely outsized returns in that timeframe.

MSTR trades at a premium so risky, and alpha case is bullshit. Own coins directly great idea but has its issues. If you like gold ETFs, like bitcoin ETFs.
[06/10/2025, 21:06:24] Nick finegold: I seemed to have sparked a healthy debate and I am grateful to you all for your comments , without your contributions this group would have no purpose. 


However. Please remember that there 240 people on this chat group and many members outside it . 

There are probably 30- 40 contributors mainly and most sit in the background and listen which is entirely their prerogative . 

That’s why Katie has started to summarise the chat everyday . It’s an attempt to make it effortless to follow for time starved people that enjoy the club in a different way ti the main contributors.

Personally, I enjoy  a bit of digital assets in this chat because it’s a vastly important asset class. 

However , I don’t want it to become overwhelmed with chat in any particular subject , because the strength of this group is its diversity of subject matter .

It’s also important not to police this chat group too heavily . Its raw nature and the brilliance of the contributors is its life blood .

All I would say is our industry has spent decades making something that’s very simple very complicated. They do this through the invention of a language that makes it hard to follow what they are saying so they can charge fees .


More buyers than Sellers it goes up , and visa versa .

Let’s use the brilliance of this  group to make sure we make complex issues simple not simple issues complex .


Thanks to you all again .
[06/10/2025, 21:31:29] ~ Dipesh Patel: Now for something very away from CryptoLand. For anyone that has followed the Starbucks sell grind 😉, it is having a tiny puke today, probably associated with old world v new. Since the lofty 'Nichols will save us' peak at 115 it's down 30% absolute, 50% relative. If anyone cares, I don't see SBUXs fortunes structurally shifting.. same demographic challenges, coffee and other cost increases issues, while he's made it clear they are not increasing prices. Margins continue to be under pressure and footfall is still a material challenge. The idea was the stock would halve or more (absolute) and I think that still remains the target. Naturally at -50% relative the chance of a value recovery is always there/tempting but my sense is increasingly that SBUX is heading to 15x and not 25x earnings.

Alaska has always been off limits for most mining funds despite holding some of the world’s largest deposits of gold and copper. Poor infrastructure and no reliable power as well as permitting issues have been the main cause. South 32 own 50% of Trilogy’s project. Paulson is a 9% shareholder of Trilogy. While the stock will bounce there isn’t much chance of trilogy being in production for 10 years.

[07/10/2025, 07:31:44] Nick finegold: From Adam :

Tesla’s Oct 7 Reveal — Wheels, Wings, or Wires?

What happened:
Tesla dropped two short teasers this week — one showing a rapidly spinning electrical component, the other a set of illuminated headlights. That’s all Elon needed to set the internet ablaze.

Three theories dominate the chatter:
	•	Aviation or Drones: The “rotor” clip looked more aerospace than automotive. Elon has long flirted with the idea of “Tesla Aviation,” and Morgan Stanley has described the company as a defence contractor disguised as a consumer brand something we brought to everyone’s attention a few mints back . 
	•	Affordable EV: With subsidies fading and margins tightening, Tesla needs a lower-priced model to sustain growth — perhaps the final human-driven Tesla before the company goes fully autonomous?
	•	Roadster Resurrection: A halo supercar could re-energise the brand while showing off new propulsion and aerodynamic tech.

⸻

🤖 The Deeper Story — Tesla’s AI & Robotics Pivot

Morgan Stanley’s latest note frames Tesla as less a carmaker, more a hardware shell for embodied AI.
The firm highlights 10 questions investors should ask of any robotics company — and Tesla quietly ticks most of them: world-class AI talent, mass-manufacturing experience, deep vertical integration, real-world data capture and a simulation stack built for humanoids.

Elon’s long-derided “vision-only” approach (no LIDAR, no radar) is starting to look prescient as GenAI blurs the line between cars, robots, and adaptive learning systems.

⸻

Why It Matters ?

Tesla’s reveal won’t just be about a new product — it’s about strategic direction.
Every clue suggests Musk wants to reposition Tesla as the world’s first AI-industrial platform — spanning cars, robots, drones and energy.

Whether it’s a fan blade or a steering wheel, the company’s endgame is clear: embodied intelligence at scale.

⸻
Fat Gladiator’s Take

The most valuable real estate in the AI race isn’t in the cloud — it’s in the physical world.
Tesla already owns the best training data for movement, interaction and perception.
Whatever launches today — a new EV, a drone, or just more smoke and mirrors — will be another breadcrumb on Tesla’s path from mobility company to AI-powered infrastructure giant.

And if it is “Tesla Aviation”?
Well… that’s when the Musk mythology goes from moonshot to full-blown Top Gun.
[07/10/2025, 07:35:50] ~ Richard Windsor: I disagree. Tesla’s obstinacy regarding lidar continues to bite it in the backside as it remains an also ran in terms of performance when it comes to AD. Its philosophical approach to AI is also wrong IMHO.
[07/10/2025, 07:43:17] Nick finegold: Yup , his full note recognises it’s a point that still stimulates much debate. What isn’t contentious is that the shares have almost doubled since we brought the above angles to people’s attention.  

We went for alphabet as out top mag 7 pick instead of Tesla . 

Interestingly I can now make videos with a single text prompt even though they are not of a high enough standard yet. I still think you tube goes exponential in the years ahead for this reason .

[07/10/2025, 09:24:00] ~ William Johnston: AI HPC more profitable than mining Bitcoin.  AI electricity infrastructure build out and massive capex.

[07/10/2025, 09:44:41] ~ Luke Dyas: Surely Tesla aviation would be focussed on the eVTOL (flying passenger drones) market not large commercial airlines. ACHR currently main US play in this space, which I own as Archer is the exclusive air taxi partner for the LA 2028 Olympics. I can't decide if this would be good or bad news for Archer. It would be more competition but Elon creating the market and forcing regulatory progress could be good for the whole space.

[07/10/2025, 16:05:21] ~ Andrew Cawker: Does anyone have a strong view on the Schaeffler (SHAO GY) turnaround? 

Auto supplies business (bearings, actuators etc) with targets to double margins post acquisition of Vitesco. Lowly rated if successful (currently on 0.5x EV/ sales and <10x EV/ EBIT. 

Wouldn’t look at it usually (for the usual German auto’s reasons), but looks cheap and spice sprinkled on the story as they appear to be positioning themselves for EV + Robotics markets. (With targets)

Currently wading through the 138 page CMD deck 😨

Have dipped a toe, but interested if anyone knows it?
[07/10/2025, 16:34:04] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Used to have a little Vitesco which turned into Schaeffler, I got tired of it and sold it so it's only logical that it would start going up soon after. German auto not a great place to be but they have an AI angle (who doesn't). Also possible that spare capacity starts getting used for defence purposes (Rheinmetall have mentioned it although not with reference to Schaeffler specifically). Looks fine I think.
[07/10/2025, 16:39:00] ~ Philip Donald: I’d rather have my money on Scotty Schaeffler. We led the Schaeffler ipo in about 2016 where the whole management team were robustly adamant that no one in their right mind would ever want an Electric vehicle !
[07/10/2025, 16:41:35] ~ Andrew Cawker: 😂

10 years later looks like they’ve got the memo. Might be BS (hence my question) but robust targets, post Vitesco synergies and Robotics potential (no revenue yet!) getting some investors interested (see the chart for details).

[08/10/2025, 03:25:15] ~ William Johnston: Tether also owns 109,000 Bitcoin in addition to its gold funded by its interest income. Its total reserves are appreciating faster than its UST holdings as the USD depreciates. There is a case for Tether to trade at a premium to its underlying NAV of UST.
[08/10/2025, 04:46:21] ~ Bram Cornelisse: Would the holders of Tether as opposed to the owners of Tether the company ever get a return?  If all the returns generated on Tether’s assets only accrue to the owners of the company a premium to NAV would not be logical.
[08/10/2025, 05:01:47] ~ William Johnston: USDT has traded at a discount albeit temporarily. This is quickly arbitraged out. But the corporate level over collateralisation enhances trust in the corporate stability.
[08/10/2025, 05:04:11] ~ Bram Cornelisse: So at best it should trade at NAV, but not at a premium.

[08/10/2025, 05:50:54] ~ Bram Cornelisse: Tether seems an amazing business: holders of Tether provide billions in interest free loans that Tether corporation gets to invest and keep the returns.  
The coporation has taken a call option from the tether holders and depending on the proportion of the reserves that they use to speculate they possibly put tether holders at risk. As long as there is no mechanism for the holders to share in the investment gains made by the corporation the tether holder has an exposure to interest-free fiat.

Conor Smith reminds us this morning that the huge amount of AI/data centre and power demand will clearly be a massive drain on water resources in the years ahead…

He likes *CC US* and *AI FP*…

Perplexity tells me that *Vertiv (VRT)* and *Schneider Electric (SU)* are considered the market leaders in both air and liquid cooling data centre solutions...
[08/10/2025, 06:49:35] ~ Andrew Cawker: Listened to an Oddlots podcast yesterday that talked about closed loop cooling systems dramatically improving water consumption in Data centres. 

Worth being aware of going forward. This from perplexity:- 

Closed loop cooling systems are dramatically reducing water demand in AI data centres by recirculating a fixed volume of coolant, rather than relying on constant external water supply and evaporation as seen in older systems. Once filled, these systems use engineered fluids or water repeatedly within a sealed network, which nearly eliminates ongoing water consumption even when cooling high-performance AI workloads. For example, Microsoft’s latest chip-level closed-loop liquid cooling system—deployed globally since August 2024—has reduced annual water use by more than 125 million litres per facility, achieving an 80% improvement in Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) versus legacy designs

Any sales are being driven by discounts. The once high margin Chinese market is now seeing very negative volumes.  So much spare capacity, so much competition as lower prices.
[08/10/2025, 09:14:12] ~ Robin Maxwell: Serica Energy -11% today on more probs at the TRITON platform. This has caused so many issues the last year and as a result they are lowing FY production guidance again this morning. The company is far too accident prone and they need to get a grip on Triton which is operated and majority owned by Dana Petroleum. Frustratingly this after the announcement of the PRAX upstream acquisition on 30/9 which had improved sentiment. I have a small position in Serica.

[08/10/2025, 10:38:08] ~ Jim: Quick Update on Coinshares

Coinshares (CS SS) SeK 159 Mk Cap US$ 940m

Current Assets $11bn. Current 12 months forward earnings c. $210m at current prices. 
So PE 4.5 x

Every $2.5bn to assets adds c $50m to earnings. (Company presentation)

Spoke with JM Mognetti to clarify two points not addressed in recent call. 

1) company not expecting any changes to their tax structure. They barely pay any tax given their Jersey jurisdiction among other quirks . So cashflow huge , rel to mk cap. 

2) The US transaction fast approaching.  Deal values CS at c. Sek 180.
Expecting price to close to that level assuming asset markets don’t collapse. It can trade above deal price however one might see arbitrage the other way assuming there’s borrowing capacity in VICIC and CS. 

No idea what the multiple should be here but feel like 10x + would be easily achievable . Plenty to go for

[08/10/2025, 12:37:10] ~ Andrew Draycott: Diageo PLC (LSE:DGE) could unlock between $5 billion and $8 billion from asset sales as part of plans to streamline its
portfolio and accelerate deleveraging, according to UBS. The Swiss bank, which maintained a 'buy' rating and 2,450p price target on the shares, believes proceeds from potential
disposals could strengthen the Smirnoff and Guinness maker's balance sheet and fund new share buybacks. Analysts identified five possible divestment targets: East African beer operations, the Chinese Baijiu business, the RCB
Indian cricket franchise, local Turkish spirits brands, and US value labels such as Captain Morgan and Seagram's 7.
Together, these represent about 11% of group sales and 12% of EBIT. UBS estimates that mid-range disposal proceeds of $6.4 billion could reduce Diageo's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x
by the 2027 and 1.9x by 2028 financial year, below the group's 2.5-3x target. The move would be likely to dilute earnings by about 5%, but the analysts reckon this could be partially offset by up to
$4.5 billion of share buybacks by FY28.
UBS said the resulting improvement in leverage and capital efficiency "should help drive a re-rating" in Diageo's shares.

[08/10/2025, 21:03:34] ~ William Nutting: Yes Mark, finally! 
On CADIZ/ CDZI US its the same pitch as a few mths back; Cadiz is a ticking time bomb of value arguably one of the most underpriced AI-infrastructure play in America. Everyone’s obsessed with silicon and servers; nobody’s clocked the fact you can’t run a 500MW datacentre without a river. FEEMI worked this out in Amarillio wjth access to a vocani aquifer there. 
Well, Cadiz owns one too, right under the Mojave desert. Long-term Holders ( like me and a few others ) have endured decades of political trench warfare meaning  it’s now battle-hardened, permitted, and sitting on a reservoir of strategic scarcity just as AI’s thirst for cooling water explodes. Forget software margins, this is geology leveraged to the 4th industrial revolution. When the hyperscalers finally come begging for cooling rights for their humming data sheds, Cadiz won’t just be a $460m utility…

Ocean Wall’s view is that this is the only fully developed integrated rare earth supply chain capable of delivering both light and heavy rare earth magnets from U.S. soil. Ben’s frequently heard refrain being “This is the next MP Materials at a $10bn discount”.

[09/10/2025, 09:02:44] ~ William Nutting: Ben. Have done a Nutstuff dive on eare earths as long time holder still of MP US.
Will dial into call and then happy to share.

A few bits…

….the West has finally woken up to the strategic insanity of depending on China for 90% of the inputs that power AI, EVs, missiles, drones, and even MRI machines. What’s driving this is industrial policy meets resource nationalism: Washington’s $3bn+ DoD funding for critical minerals, IRA tax credits, and private capital rotations out of tech hype into the things that make tech possible. The irony? The winners are still tiny…
…The next decade’s AI powerhouses won’t be digital first, they’ll be physical and dirty: rare earths are like the new silicon.….
…Put Ocean Walls USA Rare Earths (private) into my peer Nutstuff peer group chart mentally and you see the missing piece. It’s not yet listed, but it’s the pre-IPO analogue to MP Materials circa 2019: a vertically-integrated bet on sovereign magnet independence. Round Top in Texas gives them light + heavy rare earths (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb) plus lithium and scandium. Stillwater, Oklahoma is the magnet factory, already producing pilot batches of sintered NdFeB magnets, the exact component every EV motor, wind turbine, and missile guidance system needs. If it executes, USA Rare Earths becomes the first American producer of both heavy and light REE magnets entirely onshore with no Chinese chemistry, no Asian feedstock & no dependency loop.

From the chief scientific officer at Rio’s 

The energy transition is seeing a marked increase in demand for copper but the pilons that carry the cables are still made out of steel. 

This week we ask whether the 5.6% yielding Rio is a buy and are interested in your feedback as iron ore prices lift off the bottom and the copper rally returns ? 

Catalysts 

New CEO has just taken over 

Copper price increasing 

Iron ore price has begun to rise 

Lithium acquisition at close to lows

Aluminium price buoyant  

These are the pillars of Rio’s future 

Net debt $14bn might benefit from lower rates?

Eu has announced protective tariffs on imported steel. 

Energy transition going at full tilt 

Weapons ordinance made of steel 


Why the stock has underperformed 

US tariffs on imports 

Iron ore & copper price had corrected 

Litigation and project uncertainty. ‎<This message was edited>

[09/10/2025, 12:52:18] ~ Luke Dyas: The cautionary parallel on valuation exuberance is fair, but I don’t think Sun Micro in 2000 is a good comparison with Shopify or the high-multiple B2C AI commerce plays today. Back then, Sun’s valuation was pricing in an internet economy that still needed fibre rollout, data centres, broadband and enterprise digital transformation, all of which took another 10 to 15 years. Shopify (and AI in general) is monetising mature infrastructure today, with very sticky recurring revenues through strong API lock-in that creates Salesforce-style switching friction, and incremental margins of around 70%, much higher than Sun ever achieved. If Shopify keeps growing at 20–30%, it can grow into its earnings multiples quickly, and the stickiness of its recurring revenues is giving investors confidence that it will and hence the willingness to look further out.

[09/10/2025, 15:30:55] ~ Katie Jackson: *The Middle East’s Golden Age Trade* ✨

After 50 years of conflict, the region could finally be on the verge of a golden age. If peace holds, the opportunity for the region to flourish is massive - with ripple effects across EMEA and broader EMs.

*Best exposure?* Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel - the trio leading the next regional growth wave. And if Iran opens up, its 90 million educated citizens could unlock the biggest upside yet.

EMs haven’t looked this attractive since 2011.

💡*How to Play It:*
The best way to position for a Middle East peace dividend is through companies tied to normalization, investment, and trade across tourism, infrastructure, finance, consumer goods, energy, and tech.

🇮🇱 *Israel:* Bank Leumi, Check Point, NICE, Elbit Systems
🇸🇦 *Saudi Arabia:* Saudi National Bank, Saudia Dairy & Foodstuff, Dallah Healthcare, Ma’aden, Saudi Telecom
🇹🇷 *Turkey:* Garanti Bank, Akbank, Turkish Airlines, KOÇ Holding, Sabanci Holdings

I was at another meeting this evening, but Fireflies automatically dialled into the Stoic Capital Curation call on my behalf, listened to the entire call, made notes, a summary and action points and when I finished my other engagement, it emailed over everything to me 🤯.

[09/10/2025, 22:06:22] ~ Ben Finegold: It’s great. We had it until every call we were on with a bank complained. It’s now been banned by most of the big banks! ‎<This message was edited>
[09/10/2025, 22:08:55] Nick finegold: We have only used firefly  for every call we have ever done since it first came out . There is nothing remotely unique about it , there will be 100 versions shortly .
[09/10/2025, 22:15:06] ~ Morgan: How does it differ from Read.Ai or Otter.Ai?

Or is it transcription and summary like Granola? This one doesn’t add a person-bot to the call
[09/10/2025, 22:20:04] ~ Dipesh Patel: I hadn't used the others before to dial into calls I couldn't attend. I think it's better at summaries and voice recognition/sounds than others  (for example in a room with lots of instruments and voices it has perfectly figured out what and who is what and who). For me better than Otter, and as I said, I had never had any of them just dial in as me onto calls (obviously looks like others have so I'm definitely behind the curve here 😬)
[09/10/2025, 22:22:07] Nick finegold: We preferred it to you being on the call as well xxxx 

It’s funny I just  assumed you were recording it but I did t realise you were not on the call , until it didn’t ask any difficult questions . ‎<This message was edited>

“Minting” is simply the blockchain’s version of striking coins at the Royal Mint,
the design, denomination, and rules are already decided; but you’re just stamping metal. 
Everyone needs to understand that value isn’t created at the mint, it’s created in the trust and demand behind it.

[10/10/2025, 08:21:25] ~ Matt H: This level of implied lease rate signals that there is increasingly severe metal supply distress in the London physical silver market with one or more parties seeking to secure physical metal to make delivery and avoid default.
This could be expected in a cash/spot metal market where large amounts of promissory notes for immediate metal ownership and delivery on demand have been sold, followed by a global shortage of the subject metal, and contract purchasers then starting to say ‘Okay, we’ll take the metal’.

*🇨🇾 Bank of Cyprus (BOCH) CFO at 11:30 (UK) today*

Cyprus’ leading bank (40% loan share) is posting 18.4% ROTE, with CET1 at 20.6%, cost/income at 36%, and targeting a 70% payout – yet it still trades on ~7x earnings.

With loan growth +31% YoY and GDP +3%, BOCH is a rare play on southern Europe’s resurgence.

[10/10/2025, 14:11:40] ~ Dominic Vail: Dull compared to ideas re crypto and Ai but I’m getting a little edgy about GBP in the run up to Rachel’ coming out party so was casting around looking at better FX alternatives. I revisited Nestle which I used to own post GFC. The stock is down 44% from its peak near 10 year lows. It’s been beset by management turnover, we now have a new Chairman ex Inditex and CEO (third in 3 years) early days but noises getting better. Concerns over US tariffs but 90% of what it sells in the US it manufactures there. Concerns over a growing anti sugar activist base (est 11% of the register) noisy but not enough to change course. Commodity prices which are well documented. It is on 15x forward earnings, free cash flow yield 4.5% ROIC 18% and a near 5% dividend yield in CHF which 1.5x covered. It’s the largest food manufacturer in the world with great brands. Activists have been circling mainly Dan Loeb at Third Point. New management have mentioned potential non core asset disposals. Their 20% stake in L’Oreal is an obvious disposal candidate which would halve their debt or give them substantial firepower to buy back shares. The stake is worth CHF37bn vs Nestle’s CHF187bn market cap or CHF57bn in total debt. There are a number of other non core assets that could also be on the block, the water division being an example. It’s not sexy but it’s cheap, has good turnaround potential and gives you a 5% yield in CHF while you wait.

This is superinteresting as if Coinbase controls BVNK, it would have a dominant, near-exclusive edge in scaling USDC payments across the EU under MiCA and significantly enable USDC to capture market share from USDT (with USDC yield accruing to Coinbase through the rev share with Circle). The newswires seem to be missing this point and viewing it as purely a technology/infrastructure/payment rails acquistion.

[11/10/2025, 10:19:55] Nick finegold: Trumps post is worth a read read . 

Donald J. Trump
@realDonaldTrump
Some very strange things are happening in China! They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it’s not manufactured in China. Nobody has ever seen anything like this but, essentially, it would “clog” the Markets, and make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World, especially for China. We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere. Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World “captive,” but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the “Magnets” and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. But the U.S. has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s. I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW! The letter they sent is many pages long, and details, with great specificity, each and every Element that they want to withhold from other Nations. Things that were routine are no longer routine at all. I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so. This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so. The Chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the Day that, after three thousand years of bedlam and fighting, there is PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. I wonder if that timing was coincidental? Dependent on what China says about the hostile “order” that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move. For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two. I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come. Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A. One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

 

DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
[11/10/2025, 10:24:26] Nick finegold: I particularly like the line “ these hostilities came out of nowhere “ 

Nothing to do with the threat of 50% tariffs then ? 

Maybe this is just another example of Trump further enriching himself on inside information or maybe there is some truth to it , the bottom line is that nobody knows anymore and that uncertainty is terrible for business.

[11/10/2025, 11:15:48] ~ Matt H: And if I were a smart banker at OW I would be heavily leaning on Amir to buy it in an all stock deal and using the most ridiculous valuation to buy a real asset

[11/10/2025, 11:17:27] ~ Matt H: Yep
[11/10/2025, 11:18:05] ~ Ben Finegold: I think the truth is that it’s a lot more expensive to get lbs out the ground than expected. UEC had originally said $60/lb got them back into production. We have been there now since 2023 and still not much happening so can only assume that breakeven is significantly higher.
[11/10/2025, 11:18:22] ~ William Nutting: With regards to the “mine today” comment, we successfully crossed over to an operating company status over the past fiscal year and are now very much in production. Will see production rates in a steady increase, especially from the newer wellfields at Christensen Ranch and start up of Burke Hollow by November. Refurbishments of the thickener and calciners at Irigaray also a strong move to increase reliability and output as we ramp up to higher levels.
[11/10/2025, 11:18:53] ~ William Nutting: Hmmmm

[11/10/2025, 11:32:19] ~ Matt H: These are tiny and don’t justify $7bn mcap. I didn’t think UEC justified a $4bn mcap but when you have a bubble in a hot sector valuations/common sense doesn’t come into the equation.

The spot price is materially higher so they stand a decent change of inflecting into profit which will really drive  positive momentum if the case.

[11/10/2025, 19:08:23] ~ Jonny Haycock: Hi Robin, I’m no expert on this specific point but I think it’s a reference to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act that permits the US President to impose tariffs on a range of stuff.

[11/10/2025, 22:24:53] ~ Matt H: If most silver is from Mexico what’s is Mexicos current tariff rate with the US.  The other silver produced around the world is mostly from polymetalic deposits as a by product of Zinc/Lead mines. Unlikely to be tariffs on Ag concentrate

[12/10/2025, 06:33:37] ~ William Nutting: Questions to be asked. 
[12/10/2025, 07:27:41] Nick finegold: The  Chinese trade war and the investigation into Qualcomm may give us no better example of how things play out . 

Xiaomi uses Qualcomm chips in all its mobile phones . So these Chinese measures hurt some Chinese companies every bit as badly as they hurt American ones. 

Xiaomi also exports a vast amount of its product suite outside China .

It’s definitely a negotiating tactic in the trade war although it’s impossible to ignore that long term the relationship will not sit easy with investors as both countries seek to lessen dependence on each other. 

We moved Qualcomm from the top 10 to the 30 for this reason. 

Companies simply cannot react at the same pace as the changing narratives between these two Governments which is why the most probable outcome is a short settlement  but a long term deteriorating in trade. 

In this mornings newsletter I talk about us owning mistakes, Qualcomm is super cheap but for a reason and maybe one of them . We shall see .
[12/10/2025, 09:35:38] ~ Katie Jackson: We also have Horizontal Robotics in the Collective 30 which predominating supplies into automotive/lidar technologies in China with emerging end markets in Robotics/AI/IoT. It supplies into Eurasia countries with no clear evidence of large scale supply into US.

Sanctions did nothing the first time and they will do nothing this time so he has taken a more hands on approach but don’t see what else he can do to cut them off.

[13/10/2025, 05:51:57] ~ JB: If Maduro goes Venezuelan oil production will accelerate. Currently 900k bpd vs peak 3.5m bpd.

Trump has started the process of removing Maduro. 

Bonds at 28c are great risk reward given all the assets Venezuela has - quite unique for EM sov bond default. 

Par + accrued is 170c.
Initial settlement likely to be 70-80c.

FPP are experts in managing the claims via their bond fund which is a pure play.
[13/10/2025, 06:00:17] ~ Richard Windsor: assuming Venezuela has made the investments required to produce it rather than let the assets rot... whats happened there?
[13/10/2025, 06:08:29] ~ JB: Chevron has been producing for years under special license. Shell got a special licence last week to re start to production. 

Chevron has been made whole the $s owed via an oil for debt swap. 

Bond holders owning USD $ bonds under US law accruing USD $ interest have not been made whole. 

Ukraine bonds trade at 54c
Russia at 31c

[13/10/2025, 06:39:43] ~ Katie Jackson: Monday Macro after Friday’s price action and weekend walk back from Smith Market Insights…

*TRUMP WIPED OUT LEVERAGE – SLATE NOW CLEAN*

Friday’s tariff bombshell (then walk-back) forced a massive leverage unwind - one of the fastest RSI collapses in history. Markets hit 50-day EMAs, flushed out weak hands, and bounced. *Technically healthy reset ahead of earnings + FOMC.*

*Key takeaways:*
- 🧹 Leverage cleared - positioning now clean.
- ⁠💵 USD fell (not your typical ‘risk-off’ move). Gold up, oil down. DXY looks weak - 98→96 could unleash liquidity.
- ⁠De-dollarisation real: China’s USD reliance past inflection point — decades in the making.
- ⁠📉 Sub-prime credit cracking: Tricolor + First Brands only the start; expect more skeletons. Hedge financials.
- ⁠Momentum real broke out on Friday - position accordingly
- ⁠🏦 Big picture: Watch Treasuries - yields could break lower post-FOMC if the Fed turns dovish.

Bottom line: Trump’s chaos just cleaned the market’s slate — expect renewed USD selling, stronger gold, weaker oil, and a pivotal Treasury breakout into late Oct/Nov.

[13/10/2025, 09:10:07] ~ Robin Maxwell: PSI Software PSAGn.DE jumps 34% after Warburg Pincus said it planned to buy the German software firm for more than 700 million euros ($812 million). PSI Software SE, is a Germany-based company that develops and integrates software for energy suppliers, manufacturers, and infrastructure operators.
[13/10/2025, 09:34:08] Adam Clib: Deutsche Numis banging the drum on Molten.
 
*Molten Ventures (Buy, TP 671p) –15 page note out. Ahead of trading update on Oct 23, we thought it would be useful to revisit the investment case. Whilst Molten Ventures' shares have risen c.20% in the last 3 months, it continues to trade at c.40% discount to the last published NAV per share of 671p/share (31/03/2025 NAV). Put another way, at the current share price, investors are getting the core portfolio (17 companies accounting for c.60% of the total gross portfolio value) for a c.5-10% discount to NAV and the rest of the emerging portfolio (c.90 companies, 40% of gross portfolio value) for free. We believe there is upside to this NAV given recent news on some of the core portfolio assets and that the discount should narrow still as the group: 1) continues to realise investments at or above carrying values, building confidence in its NAV, and 2) balances the pipeline of investment opportunities with the ability to drive returns to shareholders through its ongoing share buyback programme, while maintaining sufficient reserves. In this note, we take a closer look at some of its holdings including Revolut, ICEYE, Ledger, Thought Machine, Riverlane and BeZero.

[13/10/2025, 10:36:58] ~ William Nutting: Nutstuff out today ..

A couple of topical things if anyone wants….and I thought CC relevant..

1. Hargreaves Lansdown (1.8m clients)  all too predictable refusal friday to even acknowledge bitcoin as an asset class. ( my take). 

2.Over the weekend the degree of Garbage and Bed-wetting market analysis from many who should know better out there ( obvs not this group!) really plumbed new depths. “No crying allowed in the casino & With returns comes risk.”

As for all the Crypto Bla bla, I now cant wait for the most hated rally in Digital assets history. 
As to “Fools and their money are easily parted”: yes of course anyone buying meme coins or Sh*tcoins backed by nothing on 10x levereage is simply foolish. 

Nutstuff however thankfully spent the day yesterday at CLIVEDEN FESTIVAL, really was good ..
Fascinating to hear the likes of the brilliant Carol Woolton on Jewellery and its history, crime authors: Anthony Horowitz and Ian Rankin on murder and why they ignore “AI”. William Boyd on spies. And Peter Frankopan on History and Geography-politics. All at the brilliant Cliveden Literary Festival; I’d highlight Peter Frankopan as an Arabist/ Russian speaker I have long listened to and we talked back when Niger decided enough was enough with CFA franc and French colonialism 2 yrs ago and nationalised their uranium asset ! 
He is so on the MASLOWS Pyramid of NEEDS thematic! (Something it seems many are only just waking up to now! ) Peter also reminded how despite the fact that Russia totally rewrote their entire policy in 2023 almost no one in UK Govt (or previous one) ever bothered to read it. We talked about the intellectually suicidal elements of Chinophobia and Russophobia and I was reminded of 45% youth Indian unemployment, heat and water stress in India and the lack of energy & water security in Taiwan. Truly fascinating….

[13/10/2025, 13:27:26] ~ Philip Donald: I know there has been quite a bit of excitement about Tesla and how it should be valued as an AI enabled Robot company , thus justifying its’ 200x PE multiple . But Tesla has now abandoned its plans to build 10,000 Optimus robots this year.  And according to The Information, the  AI lead of the Optimus project has left Tesla for Meta….
In September, Elon Musk said that Optimus robots could eventually make up 80% of Tesla’s enterprise value. 
If Tesla  were to lose 80% of its current enterprise value, it would still be worth over $100 billion more than Ford and GM…

[13/10/2025, 14:08:38] ~ Richard Windsor: xAI on the other is interesting...

[13/10/2025, 14:27:20] ~ Dipesh Patel: Likewise am short similar timing 😬. Not for faint hearted. My view is that the mkt prices in humanoids etc for Tesla as if it's a homerun. Things are just not that clear. There are a lot of companies up to a lot of things and I doubt it will be a homerun for Tesla. That said the company does have lots of other things it can realise. He's building, like all the big guys, a moat of interesting businesses around the core car business. I think that car business is challenged and I think it's more than Meta's core FB product or Google's search (yes even in a chat world). If the cash cow stalls without one of the other businesses delivering, Tesla will struggle
[13/10/2025, 14:36:08] ~ Philip Donald: I do know that Open AI alone is planning to boost its electricity usage 125X in the next 8 years….. meaning it would need the equivalent of 250 nuclear power plants!

There is NO way there is enough power for these beasts for when they plan to switch them on.

We have said this for months and Nick Lawson etc too. There is next to no mkt cap.
Everyone is now waking up to NEEDS VS WANTS. 
If you simply flipped Maslow’s hierarchy into a market chart, you’d see the absurdity instantly. The entire edifice of global market cap is crammed into the tiny, glittering top tech, AI, luxury where valuations levitate on narratives about transcendence and machine consciousness. Meanwhile, the bottom, where civilisation actually resides energy, uranium, rare earths, defence all remain neglected and thinly owned. The irony is brutal: investors have poured trillions into “self-actualisation” stocks that depend entirely on the physical security layers they’ve ignored. No uranium, no AI. No diesel, no delivery. No rare earths, no robots. The next decade won’t reward whoever codes the cloud it’ll reward whoever owns the power plant that keeps it alive. In short, markets have built their pyramid upside-down, and smart small money has been been quietly buying the foundations not the towers.
[13/10/2025, 17:59:27] ~ Stretch: Totally agree. Which is why I think energy companies are doubling and oil goes through $100 a barrel.

[13/10/2025, 20:11:39] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Without checking the figures, I'd hazard a guess that this cycle is way more hardware/infrastructure heavy. The internet cycle was a lot more weighted to software. So now a lot more capex, not necessarily more value. The likely beneficiaries are upstream (capex recipients) and application providers (asset light) if successful. The years of massive buybacks by hyperscalers are gone, money will go to capex and they may raise debt too. Among the big spenders, it is important to pick the winners, that's why they go full on at any cost.

[13/10/2025, 20:26:39] ~ Zac Bobolakis: Incidentally, this is linked to the previous discussion about whether Tesla is also ran in AI. This partly depends on one's view about what determines the winner in AI: (1) engineering edge (e.g. first to singularity if you believe in the concept), (2) execution at scale or (3) ability to generate revenue. Probably a combination but: if (1) OpenAI, Anthropic and Google are pioneers, others incl Tesla are also ran. If (2) Tesla has a chance because of Elon's audacity and track (although OpenAI seems at least as audacious). If (3) I'd think MSFT and Google have the edge. Prob depends on all three but overall I'd say chances are Tesla will remain an also ran.
[13/10/2025, 20:36:14] ~ Dipesh Patel: As you say, key is figuring out who you back to have the best direct revenue opportunities. This time, they have history in their ammo to help figure out where they can play best. They all have decent track records as well, give or take (can't probably say for OpenAI). Maybe it's all of them in their specific areas? If you're spending a trillion, I suspect there is a ss somewhere with a breakdown of the potential revs for each of them. You'd back who you trust to deliver on that the most. ‎<This message was edited>

[14/10/2025, 09:21:03] ~ Robin Maxwell: Just referencing yesterday’s Maduro conv… surely Trump’s strategy is to push for regime change in order to increase oil production and see oil price fall ? If you accept he is attempting to position stars for a late 1920’s style rally (roaring 20’s only really got going in 1925) then he needs to keep falling interest rate narrative real and key to that is not allowing oil to re-accelerate inflation.  If you are right - then Trumps plan fails and we better get a lot more defensive.
[14/10/2025, 09:33:54] ~ Katie Jackson: *Short Autos ⬇️ 🚗*

@⁨~JB⁩ has been banging this drum for awhile and this morning SMI adds two new short positions…

Momentum shift turning brutal in autos – *shorts Ford (US) and BMW (EZ)*.

*Joint rationale:*
Sector (SXAP) closed on its lows even as broader markets bounced. Sub-prime tremors (Tricolor, First Brands bankruptcies) now bleeding into mainstream autos. Michelin cut its 2025 outlook, Goodyear sold off, and Western CEOs returning from China “terrified” by the superiority of Chinese EV manufacturing.

*Individual nuances:*
	•	Ford – viewed as existentially threatened, CEO admits “we do not have a future if we lose this.” Short added as sector seen heading for “complete collapse.”
	•	BMW – post-profit warning, chart nearing a death cross. Structural pressure and worsening sector news expected to drag it further.

*In short:* Global autos look broken — cost, quality, and competitiveness all tilting East. 

Supportive of Collective 30 stock *Horizon Robotics* which supplies chips into Chinese auto sector.

So I guess we're seeing the first of the large scale product deals/ use cases today with Walmart and Open AI. Can't figure out exactly how it will drive way more revs for Walmart. I guess it creates stickiness and ChatGPT creates an auto basket for the user under various scenarios so they buy everything from Walmart. The CEO quote takes a dig at Google traditional search.

[15/10/2025, 01:39:52] Nick finegold: If anyone with Chinese connections could help verify this it could be the home run of the century . 

It dovetails with what Jonny was saying earlier about no silver Britannia coins .
[15/10/2025, 01:41:04] Nick finegold: Everyone’s staring at the spot price pretending silver’s $50 an ounce.

But step into the real world. China’s top bullion marketplace is now posting $128/oz for physical silver.

That’s not a typo. That’s four times the 2020 price and double today’s “official” rate.

The global silver shortage isn’t coming. It’s already here.

Perth Mint has halted all silver product sales.
India’s dealers have vanished or defaulted on shipments.
Amazon sellers are taking money and not delivering metal.
Even the Royal Canadian Mint and TD Bank show “out of stock” on nearly every bar.

This isn’t a paper disconnect. It’s a total breakdown in physical supply.

In Japan, Asahi Fine, a world-class refiner, is out of ingots.
In London, lease rates have exploded to 39 percent, panic levels not seen in decades.
Banks can’t locate metal and are being forced to cover or buy back futures just to stay solvent.

It’s chaos.

And through all of this, China quietly sets the new world price.
Their retail bars are fetching between $108 and $128 an ounce, and that’s for the small bars retail investors can actually hold.

Sellers always move to where they’re treated best.
If a refiner or trader can earn twice as much shipping to China, why would they sell into New York or London at half the rate?

The result: China’s premiums become the new global standard.

Silver goes where it’s valued highest, and right now the East is valuing it like gold.

Meanwhile, the West is still obsessed with “spot” prices that no longer mean anything. Futures, ETFs, and “paper silver” are detached from reality. IOUs trading in a system that can’t deliver.

For those holding physical, this is the moment the market has been building toward for years, when scarcity becomes undeniable and the paper façade cracks.

What happens next?
Expect those $128 Chinese premiums to ripple outward fast.
Dealers in the US and Canada will raise quotes just to restock.
Industrial users will panic-buy to secure supply.
And small investors who mocked silver stackers will suddenly realize the shelves are empty.

This is what a global repricing looks like.

The shortage is systemic, and silver is finally being priced like the strategic, irreplaceable metal it truly is.

The age of cheap silver is over.
[15/10/2025, 02:00:56] Nick finegold: I can’t find any evidence to suggest the above is true . But it’s late !
[15/10/2025, 02:02:25] Nick finegold: Could be a rogue tweet but there is no doubt that supply is tight and tightening

[15/10/2025, 08:09:52] ~ Richard Windsor: Yes I would have thought that regime change means more supply from these countries not less.... The big questiuon is whether they have mad ethe investments to be able to ramp up supply or whether it takes them 5 years to get the supply moving... therte is a large industry deficit in supply starying someytime around 2030 due to under invesytment in sustainable capex
[15/10/2025, 08:10:52] ~ William Nutting: All so relevant to the bigger issue ..



NEEDS VS WANTS. 
If you simply flipped Maslow’s hierarchy into a market chart, you’d see the absurdity instantly. The entire edifice of global market cap is crammed into the tiny, glittering top tech, AI, luxury where valuations levitate on narratives about transcendence and machine consciousness. But as Jim M and me have joked for many years, so much of it is just “time wasting”. 
Meanwhile, the bottom, where civilisation actually resides as does stuff that really matters: food ( yes soya beans!) energy, uranium, rare earths, defence & security; all remain neglected and thinly owned with minimal benchmark/ index relevance. The irony is brutal: investors have poured trillions into “self-actualisation” stocks that depend entirely on the physical security layers they’ve ignored. No uranium, no AI. No diesel, no delivery. No rare earths, no robots. The next decade won’t reward whoever codes the cloud it’ll reward whoever owns the power plant that keeps it alive. In short, markets have built their pyramid upside-down, and smart small money has been been quietly buying the foundations not the towers.
Ask yourself where Energy is in this. 
Also never forget: “Energy makes money. Tech spends it.”

[15/10/2025, 08:13:17] ~ David Haysey: For all the hype about nuclear, geothermal etc natural gas is the only live and workable solution to the problem of baseload power. This more than anything is why I think Russia will be rehabilitated. Interestingly one of the last commentaries from Bessent’s hedge fund before he went onto greater things made the point that while renewables were falling in price the baseload problem was only soluble via Nat gas. This was before the AI energy issue emerged but this can only be more true. I bought (and continue to own) GTT on the back of this.

[15/10/2025, 09:23:36] ~ JB: ASPI 

The share price is up 258% since March 2025.

Up from 91c since Oct 2023 when we did the 1st placing. 

This placing is open to all investors via Cantor or Lucid.  Orders by 11am UK time and please CC us. 

Use of proceeds in the prospectus are very general - for now. 

On Monday the company secured its largest Silicon 28 contract from a US semiconductor company after months of due diligence on samples and engineering process. 

Semiconductors use the highest precision processes around. 

Pet Labs also entered the US radio pharmacy market for the 1st time.  Pet Labs can 5x EBITDA when put next to a GE cyclotron.   ASPI will lease 2 cyclotrons pa for the next 10 years. 

ASPI has ample growth opportunities across all businesses:
1. Nuclear fuels
2. ⁠Semis / Q Computing 
3. ⁠Cancer drugs / Pet Labs
4. ⁠Helium - Renergen

Post this Silicon 28 commercialisation I think the risk / reward in ASPI is the best it has ever been. 

The company has a lot of capacity to build and demand to satisfy. 

Nov 12th / 13th - Investor days in Pretoria - mgmt will show how they get to $300m of EBITDA by 2030. Worth attending. 

What mutitple should that be on? 10x / 15x / 20x.
[15/10/2025, 09:29:12] ~ Katie Jackson: I don’t but GTT doesn’t really trade of French political risk and most/all revenues are offshore/int. It has proprietary membrane technology to transport LNG in tankers and licenses this technology to the ship yards. Others have tried and failed to compete with their technology. It trades on the announcement of any new fleet orders (particularly coming from the Middle East) and gas prices. If you believe that gas is the bridging/part of base load fuel globally then GTT is a low capex, quality name with monopoly over mkt. +25% YTD

[15/10/2025, 13:41:59] ~ Ben Finegold: The Janus Program, launched by the US Army yesterday, focuses on deploying safe, mobile, and resilient microreactors (under 20 MW) to power military installations and operations globally by 2028, building on Project Pele and leveraging advanced nuclear technologies for energy security. This initiative creates opportunities for companies in the nuclear sector, particularly those involved in microreactor development, fuel enrichment, and component supply, as it accelerates commercialisation, addresses fuel needs like high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), and uses milestone-based contracting similar to NASA's models.

Names to know...

ASP Isotopes: Specialising in laser-based isotope enrichment, ASP Isotopes is advancing HALEU production facilities in South Africa and partnering with US entities like Fermi America to host domestic enrichment sites. Though not yet Defencse Innovation Unit ("DIU") qualified - a requirement to be approved for use by DOD - its technology addresses Janus's fuel constraints by enabling scalable, efficient HALEU supply, supporting the program's goal of reducing reliance on foreign sources and enhancing national security through advanced reactor fuels. Wholly owned subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy ("QLE") which is solely focused on nuclear fuels should like in Q4 2026 as publicly disclosed.

BWXT (BWX Technologies): BWXT is the main supplier of nuclear related services to the US Government and plays a key role in nuclear components and fuel fabrication, including TRISO fuel for advanced reactors and core manufacturing for Project Pele, which Janus complements as a fixed-site counterpart. Its advanced technologies division is DIU-qualified for microreactor efforts, positioning it for contracts in enrichment equipment, centrifuge manufacturing, and system integration under Janus, with potential revenue from defense-backed offtake.

Centrus Energy (LEU): As the only US producer of HALEU at commercial scale (with 900 kg demonstrated at Piketon), Centrus is crucial for fueling Janus microreactors, especially given the executive order's directive for a DOE HALEU fuel bank of at least 20 metric tons. The program's emphasis on domestic fuel supply to de-risk early deployments benefits Centrus, which is expanding capacity and securing investments, leading to pre-market stock surges tied to Janus announcements.

Energy Fuels (UUUU): As the largest U.S. uranium producer, Energy Fuels plays a pivotal role in the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain by mining and processing uranium ore into concentrate (U3O8), with record production rates reaching about 96,000 pounds per month in 2025 and plans to ramp up further to meet growing demand. This directly supports the Janus Program's fuel requirements, which emphasise a secure, full uranium fuel cycle for microreactors needing HALEU. Recent $700 million funding for expanded production hubs further positions it to supply uranium for military applications, enhancing energy security and de-risking Janus deployments.

Oklo: As a developer of fast fission microreactors (e.g., Aurora model, 1.5-15 MW), Oklo is directly relevant, having been pre-qualified by the DIU for advanced nuclear power initiatives that Janus expands upon. The program validates Oklo's factory-built, refuel-rarely designs for remote or resilient power, with market reactions showing stock surges and analysts viewing it as a tailwind for deployment timelines. Oklo's ongoing Air Force base project at Eielson AFB further aligns with Janus's goals for military siting. We think this is fully valued but a name to watch.

It got hyped up on new online engagement story which disappointed, had issues on new distribution facilities and then got caught up in the CMA’s review on vet pricing last year/this year… noticed today that this review overhang has been removed. 

Terrible comms… I hold it against mgmt teams when you meet them a week before a profit warning and big up how good full year and year ahead will be - they did this at end of 2024, which is when I sold PA. They continued to have terrible comms throughout the CMA review and the distribution facility issues… “nothing to see here” attitude 💨🪞

Discount now out at 25% as they have had to stop share buybacks since they are close to the 35% minimum for independent shareholders required to maintain investment trust status. 

The obvs way out (which I’m sure they will do,  as management have such large shareholdings) will be to merge w another trust. But that will, of course, take time. 

So, if you believe in the underlying holdings ( 72% in Nvidia, Microsoft & Broadcom) and a catalyst that will close the discount, then the shares are as attractively priced as they have been for 10 years.
One for the patient.

[16/10/2025, 11:12:40] Nick finegold: Massive Spanish Government Defence Loans (Oct 15th):

The Spanish government approved approximately €6.9 billion in zero-interest loans for the military industry's Special Modernisation Programmes (PEMs).

Indra is the primary beneficiary, receiving over €2.178 billion directly for nine PEM projects.

Indra and its associated joint ventures (like TESS Defence) are calculated to receive nearly 96% of the allocated funds, underscoring its central role as the main driver of Spain's defence ecosystem.

Combat Cloud Flight Test Demonstration (Oct 15th):

Indra publicly demonstrated its new experimentation and flight test capabilities to the Spanish Air and Space Force at its Flight Test Center.

The highlight was a trailblazing flight demonstration of its NIMBUS combat cloud—one of the first such tests in Europe—a critical technology for the collaborative combat of the future.

The company also showcased its VALERO multipurpose aerial vehicle for electronic warfare missions.

[16/10/2025, 20:00:04] ~ Robin Maxwell: Sartorius Stedim (DIM) Millipore and Pall are effectively a global triopoly at the centre of future production of Biotech drugs. The theme got massively overhyped in a zero interest rate environment in 2020/21. But it’s a powerful theme and in particular DIM drove the adoption of single use bioprocessors which are now at the core of the industry. It’s still a play on the growth of biotech and biosimilar drug production. There are other parts at play in biolab equipment which seems to be stabilising after going ex growth. That will prove to be a distraction longer term. DIM grew sales in all regions and significantly expanded margin on improved mix. Now guiding for top end of 2025 guidance. Reasons to believe we may be back on the path investors previously overhyped.

[17/10/2025, 07:15:52] Nick finegold: To this day I have rarely heard the expression of what I believe to be the real gold story. 

Yes of course institutional investors are underweight , rates may drop and geopolitical risk is elevated . But the single most bearish point historically on gold is that outside of Jewelry it’s useless , expensive to store and insure. 

That all changes when you digitise it and back it with real gold on the block chain because you can start to borrow against it. Collateralise gold and  its use cases explode. 

Would you rather own a stable coin backed by an infinite supply of $’s or a stable coin backed by gold that remains in scarse supply ? 

The gold narrative historically has always been about wealth protection thus shutting the door on tens of millions of retail investors who have little wealth to protect , however , if gold gets sexy , not dull,  as I believe is happening, the doors opens to millions who might buy it to accumulate wealth not protect it and the leopard truly changes  the colour of its spots .

The team attended a WGC film premiere with Elton John in this week on gold !!!  They must have spent a fortune on it .

The WGC are taking gold to the parts on the market it historically never reached , backed by a $200m annual budget to promote it. 

Hardly anyone still understands this yet in my opinion , because they don’t understand the long term mission of the WGC 24/7 project . ‎<This message was edited>

Wholesale Digital Gold

“The potential of representing physical gold in a digitalised format will unlock new opportunities for the market, including increased liquidity and enabling the use of gold as collateral. In order to achieve this, the gold market needs structural reform to allow digital products to operate independently of specific custodians, while still offering ownership of underlying physical gold.

The Wholesale Digital Gold concept could enhance how gold is owned, traded, and utilised by bridging the gap between the two ways gold is currently settled in the wholesale market – allocated and unallocated gold.”

I don’t like short term calls or profit taking because it gets us out of a story that’s just getting better and better . 

If gold goes where I think god knows what happens to silver that actually has industrial use cases . 

Please try to reduce the short term profit calls on the chat , you may will be right , of course it can trade down 10-15% as can any asset that’s climbed 100% but it screws up peoples minds .

Nutstuff says BS to Gold tokenisation but Film Premiers are really fun! 

Nutstuff has rejigged his Digital Portfolio a bit, 3 names out and new one in, 32% exposure still. 

Lord Richard’s podcast with the brilliant Sam Kiley is pure common sense on issues like Ukraine like that still so few seem willing to listen to.

On Stocks: 
I wrote up CARDIOL (after their funding raise late friday) at $1.00 I am absolutely locked & loaded.

I love Energys stealth strength. Clearly resolute on my North sea names ⬆️ ( update on a newer idea; ENQUEST / ENQ LN an energy play with some
North Sea assets emphatically not a stranded asset story and actually a functioning mid-tier operator with cash-generative barrels the market has priced as if they’re running dry.

And a A NEW $9bn idea; just waking up, 1st analyst meeting in 4years in a week and it owns the infrastructure everyone else is desperate & begging for; electrons, land, and regulatory forgiveness. I see chance of a proper re-rating.

[20/10/2025, 17:50:04] ~ William Nutting: Ok. Mystery over..
ALCOA/ AA US..
Have been watching this and suddenly it is stumbling back into relevance, a $9 billion aluminium producer that’s quietly sitting on the three most valuable assets of the AI century: Power, Permits and Processing. For years, it’s been the dullest of tickers, melting ore while the world chased software. But as compute becomes the new oil, Alcoa looks less like a metals relic and more like a stranded energy arbitrage. Making aluminium is essentially turning electricity into metal, and Alcoa has locked-in megawatts across 24 sites worldwide, that is power contracts, grid access, and the one thing no data-centre or rare-earth refinery can get quickly: permission to exist!  
It’s hosting its first analyst day in 4 years on 30 October, a timing too deliberate to be coincidence. I would expect little from earnings but everything from the subtext: how to monetise vast, permitted, powered footprints. One site in East Virginia is already leased to a Bitcoin miner, its renewal looming; another in Texas sits on the kind of capacity hyperscalers would sell their souls for. 
The CFO’s remarks at Morgan Stanley hinted at a capital-allocation rethink that to me is code for a coming “re-rating” the old business as a new asset class. I am not suggesting Alcoa becomes an AI darling, it doesn’t need to. It just needs investors to realise it owns the infrastructure everyone else is begging for; electrons, land, and regulatory forgiveness. Hits my Key Nutstuff thematic; in a world short of watts and patience, AA is the unintentional DePIN of the industrial age — power made tangible, scarcity wrapped in metal.

[21/10/2025, 07:55:35] ~ Dipesh Patel: For anyone interested China/Luxury ideas and keen to look at something new, todays news for Bosideng I feel is HUGE. Bosideng is a HK listed,  exceptionally high quality, cheap alternative to Moncler. They make amazing jackets for the price. They have a cool store on South Molten Street with fridges and you can try the jackets and coats for different temperature uses. I loved the product and have owned the shares this year. Not expensive on around 12x. But the mkt has always tried to figure out what next. Chinese consumers love the brand and it's increasingly getting a global reach. I suspect a lot changes today as they have just announced Kim Jones as creative director for their new luxury sub-brand (prev Dior Men, Dunhill, LVMH). He is a go to fashion designer and looks like they might be creating one of the first domestic luxury brands in clothing. I think this is an incredibly interesting play for people looking for something new, underowned/known about, reasonably priced, probably AI immune and profitable. Ticker is 3998 HK.
Outside of tech/nuclear/AI noise, I can see how investing in this/Kim Jones  over the next 2-3 years carries decent risk/reward. Tariffs/US/China would be the noise factor but I think this will do its own thing.

I hate FOMOing into positions and use DeMark to guide judicious entry points. I own physical gold (ie not paper gold). Long term I see massive money printing and debasement of Fiat currencies. The best defence is owning hard money ie gold and Bitcoin. Also the transformational trades. AI is even more powerful than the Industrial Revolution. But my benchmark is Bitcoin’s 50% CAGR. Ultimately Bitcoin will surpass golds market cap. AI will change everything we do and there will be mass unemployment.  Short term the question is how to play it. There are the picks and shovels, but I am interested in OpenAI and others like Anthropic. No doubt like the Internet there will be a winner that no one yet knows about… ‎<This message was edited>

[21/10/2025, 17:24:29] ~ Matt H: The gold price is most correlated to M2 money supply Speculation joined in which increased golds volatility (arguably it went up too quick and is now correcting a bit) but if you believe M2 goes up then gold should follow. The question on whether to own physical or gold miners then I would always say own the miners in a rising gold price environment especially if the oil price is low as margins increase exponentially. 
I own Allied Gold primarily because they are building a new mine in Ethiopia.  Production should start in April with commercial production a few months afterwards. The company is on track to produce around 375koz of Gold this year at circa $2000 cost. The new mine in Ethiopia should produce at $1300/oz and its annual production will be 250koz+. Total production in 2027 should be 650k-700koz which is real growth while costs fall. It did take advantage of the market last week and raise money when arguably it didn’t need to & the shares have seen a pull back. 
It’s worth holding physical gold( coins and bars) just in case you need to leave somewhere quickly.

[21/10/2025, 17:46:02] ~ William Nutting: A Nutstuff Golden rule has always been  : “When everyone loves something it must go down and when everyone hates something it may go up “. 
Well thats Gold vs Oil ( and arguably Bitcoin alot of Digital assets!) 
“ Gold was the asset of fear. Bitcoin and oil are the assets of conviction.”
IMHO, Gold’s done its job for now; it front-ran the liquidity cycle, soaked up geopolitical fear, and became the only thing even the bond mob could agree on. But once every newsletter, asset allocator, pension fund and TikTok macro bro is “diversified into gold,” there’s no one left to buy, its not the queue forming outside Sharps Pixley thats going to make a difference. We all know instances of when Momentum rapidly becomes gravity. You end up owning a lump of reassurance rather than an asymmetry. That’s why the miners might look interesting later, but IMHO not now. When the trade clears out, and the tourists sell to fund margin calls, you want to be ready for the next leg the one driven by actual M2 growth, not emotion. Right now, gold’s absolutely not a contrarian idea. It’s simply a comfort blanket. And comfort blankets rarely make you rich.
I know many talk to me about “tokenising” gold but most have no understanding of what a true tokenisation strategy & model looks like and to me its still an inert rock, just with a QR code. 
Ask what Nutstuff is buying with the proceeds … its the “other” asset. Its Oil which I have owned alot of in North Sea and also the one where the 2021 Retail investors havent come back to but I feel ever surer they will.

[21/10/2025, 18:17:16] ~ Dominic Vail: Thought this was interesting from Doomberg for those interested in European autos….The possession of anything begins in the mind.” – Bruce Lee

A day after the US Department of Commerce dramatically expanded export controls on Chinese companies by roping in their subsidiaries, a remarkable escalation in the trade war transpired. At the urging of the US government—and specifically because of the new export controls—Dutch authorities executed a shocking takeover of a vitally important subsidiary of a Chinese-owned company:

“At the height of the cold war, the Netherlands passed a law allowing the state to take over companies for security purposes. After gathering dust for 73 years, the law has at last been put to use. On September 30th the Ministry of Economic Affairs quietly took control of Nexperia, a semiconductor firm headquartered in Nijmegen that had been bought in 2019 by Zhang Xuezheng, a Chinese entrepreneur. A week later an Amsterdam business court suspended Mr Zhang (known by his nickname ‘Wing’) as CEO, replacing him with a Dutch interim chief. The moves were made public by the Dutch press on October 12th. They are among the most aggressive steps yet by European governments to protect strategic industries from China.”

We suspect few of you had heard of Nexperia until last week, but the company plays a critical role in many supply chains, most notably automotive and consumer electronics. For all the attention high-end computer chip designers like Nvidia receive, the base of the semiconductor pyramid—characterized by older designs, huge volumes, and low prices—permeates the modern economy. The post-Covid chip shortage of 2021 highlighted how important these commodities are, and scenes of vast parking lots stuffed with new cars unsellable without them serve as a stark reminder of the disruption their absence unleashes.


Dollars held up by pennies | The Detroit News
Nexperia is a major player in that end of the semiconductor industry. The company ships more than 110 billion discrete semiconductor devices annually, or roughly 10% of global market share. It is particularly essential to the automotive industry, where it supplies approximately 35–40% of diodes and discrete transistors, among other products—parts that cost as little as a few cents each but are indispensable for nearly every electronic function in a vehicle.

Amazingly, the brazen move by Dutch and US officials does not appear to have been fully thought through, as the obvious and economically devastating countermeasures China would almost certainly take seem to have been wildly underestimated. So shocking is the one-dimensional chess Western leaders are playing that it raises serious doubts about their appraisal of China’s economic, geopolitical, and military might. Let’s explore why.


There is one small problem with seizing control of Nexperia: it has a major factory in China, without which much of the company essentially cannot function. Although Nexperia produces wafers in its German and British facilities, the majority of that output is shipped for back-end manufacturing to Dongguan, China—including assembly, packaging, and electrical testing. The sprawling 860,000-square-foot plant is essential infrastructure for Nexperia’s entire supply network.

In a move that can hardly be considered surprising, China retaliated swiftly:

“China is blocking Nexperia from exporting products from the Asian nation after the Dutch government moved to seize control of the chipmaker.

China retaliated after the Dutch government invoked a Cold War–era law to take control of Nexperia, to ensure Europe retains access to its products. The company is a subsidiary of China’s Wingtech Technology and a key supplier of mature chips used by the automotive and consumer electronics industries.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued an export control notice earlier this month, prohibiting Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting some components, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Nexperia said it is trying to obtain an exemption.”


Whoops | Nexperia
Unless the standoff ends soon, the auto industry outside China will be thrown into a major crisis:

“The scale of the crisis cannot be overstated. Nexperia produces… a sprawling portfolio of discrete semiconductors, diodes, transistors and MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors, a type of semiconductor device used for switching and amplifying electronic signals) that perform unglamorous but absolutely vital functions in vehicles…

On 10 October, automakers and their tier 1 suppliers received notice from Nexperia that it could no longer guarantee delivery of its chips to the automotive supply chain. The implications for automotive production are baked-in. Following the communication, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) reported that existing stocks would last only several weeks.”

According to a report by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, the Chinese have escalated the situation, taking first steps to fully seize the Dongguan facility:

“Nexperia China, the local unit of the Dutch chipmaker, has told its employees to follow orders from local management and ignore instructions from the Dutch head office, according to a letter issued to employees over the weekend.

In open revolt against the headquarters in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, Nexperia China said in a Chinese-language statement on its official social media channel on Saturday that it was an ‘independent’ Chinese entity and that Nexperia employees in China ‘should continue to follow instructions from Nexperia China.’”

China’s domestic automotive industry will ride out the upcoming storm just fine, of course, with ready access to local supplies. As this excellent article by Michael Dunne on Substack points out, the country has the capacity to build more than 50 million cars per year but only produces about 60% of that number, and Dunne speculates that China’s recent actions might even be part of a broader plan to further dominate the industry.

The damage China is capable of spans far beyond the automotive sector. A scan of market-cap rankings in the S&P 500 reveals dozens of similar vulnerabilities: Apple, Qualcomm, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Honeywell, Caterpillar, Walt Disney—the tally of firms with high concentration risk in China is a long one. For all of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bissent’s media bluster, the US cannot decouple from China in the short- or even medium-term without collapsing its own economy and stock market.

As the Nexperia affair so vividly exposes, there’s a sequencing issue, and a fairly significant one at that.

[21/10/2025, 23:43:39] ~ William Nutting: Resend: CARDIOL/CRDL: revisiting at $1.00! It now sits in that tiny corner of biotech where funding, validation, and valuation collide. A $90 million company chasing a $30 billion disease, it’s finally moving from survival mode to a conviction story. The fresh $11 million raise announced last friday at $1.00,( insiders included), extends cash through Q3 2027, fully funding the Phase III MAVERIC trial in recurrent pericarditis and the planned FDA NDA submission with another $7.4 million in potential warrant proceeds if the market wakes up. The science has quietly shifted from treating inflammation to reversing heart failure itself: the ARCHER data show regression in left-ventricular mass cardiology’s holy grail, a structural marker that predicts survival. At this point, the company’s $90 million market cap prices it below the cash-adjusted value of peers like Kiniksa, Tenaya, or Cytokinetics, all trading 5–10× higher with less clinical clarity. The irony is brutal: Wall Street still files Cardiol under “weed-adjacent biotechs,” but what’s emerging is a cardiac-inflammation platform with three multi-billion-dollar indications: recurrent pericarditis, myocarditis, and heart failure. The next 12 months will determine whether this remains yet another forgotten micro-cap or becomes the first small-cap in modern history to prove you can remodel a human heart. Nutstuffs bed is made.

At 1.8% of global manufacturing versus China at 30%, any deal with the US would be a significant boost for growth longer term.

However this will depend on super majority consensus. Achieving consensus can be very messy as we saw in 2017. But consensus was reached in the Fork Wars.  Worst case is consensus is not reached and Quantum computers hack the dormant addresses (3-4m).  The Segwit addresses on the Bitcoin protocol are already quantum resistant due to the way the addresses are hashed. Ethereum addresses are more vulnerable. Mining may accelerate but the 2 week difficulty adjustment will prevent Quantum dominating the mining system. ‎<This message was edited>

[22/10/2025, 18:46:10] ~ Andy Raikes: This caught my eye too as been discussing this topic recently. Rio is under pressure to resolve the issue of PLC UK line trading at big discount to Oz Ltd line (24% as of yesterday, whereas tax differences supposedly warrant c. 15%), including recent activism arguing for collapsing dual listing structure. Rio has defended the dual structure, but is keen to pull whatever levers it can to reduce the PLC discount. One way to do this would be to buy back shares in PLC, but currently it can’t as the Chinalco stake is very close to the 15% cap in the PLC line (and chinalco seemingly don’t want to participate in a buyback). Hence the strategic imperative for Rio to resolve this impasse caused by the chinalco stake. One potential way to resolve this is to do an asset swap, as per this press story - ie exchange some or all of the equity stake for a stake in an asset(s). But biggest potential barrier to this is that it would require government approval from the country where the asset is domiciled, which one could imagine may well not be forthcoming. So I think definitely a positive that they are trying to resolve it - but maybe easier said than done. Maybe hear more on this topic at Rio forthcoming CMD.

It’s quite possible if new sanctions bite that Russia takes the same view on enriched uranium as China has on rare earths . 

So although as Centrus falls because its revenues are under threat and its value  might fall from ridiculous levels . It’s quite possible that this intensifies the need to an even greater extent for technologies in the west  that can enrich uranium . 

Bottom line - these juiced uranium stocks are all selling off but I think its  probably pretty good for anyone who claims to be able

[22/10/2025, 21:44:17] ~ Ben Finegold: Centrus rely on Russia for about 90% of revenues. Think of them as a broker who sell Russian enriched uranium to U.S. utilities at a premium. 

They have a HALEU business that has produced less than 1 tonne and cost them several billion $ - it will not scale in our view which is why we need new enrichment tech such as ASPI / SILEX / General Matter 

U.S. has not been able to sanction Russian uranium since the war because they are utterly reliant on it. The U.S. is the largest consumer of nuclear fuel in the world and relies on imports for more than 95% of it…hence the massive run in U.S. uranium linked names eg UUUU / UEC 

Not sure what sanctions we will see tomorrow but would expect nuclear fuel to be involved which won’t hurt prices of physical uranium or the equities 

Still like UUUU as preferred US play and ASPI worth topping up at these levels ‎<This message was edited>

On LIGHTBRIDGE/ LTBR US.
( a reminder and caveat it remains my 2025 CC stock competition play ) 
No sanctions exposure a U.S. IP play.
Incremental to existing infrastructure. 
Politically attractive “home-grown nuclear tech”. 
They already have co-development agreements with Framatome (EDF Group) and work through the Idaho National Lab (INL) the right names to commercialise.  
With the DOE desperate to accelerate anything that breaks Russian dependence, grant money and pilot orders flow to players exactly like LTBR.
LTBR trades at a sub-$100m EV so barely registers on most radars! 
Yes Yes, No revenues yet, but that’s typical of pre-commercial nuclear tech; and yes it’s essentially an option on U.S. re-industrialisation of fuel.
Compare that to billions thrown at Centrus’s failed HALEU dream.
LTBR’s potential ROI on success is totally asymmetrical. If DOE funding or a commercial utility test comes through (possible within 12-18 months), the re-rating could still be really violent.

When does Tesla pull the safety driver for robotaxi? We think it’s by 1Q26. Robotaxi seems to be getting solved faster than nearly anyone thought.

When does Tesla get FSD approval in Europe and China? Could be a big unlock for what is likely Tesla’s highest margin product (not-disclosed). We estimate incremental margins for FSD subscriptions could be in the 90%-range.

When can investors get a good look at Optimus production and operation in Tesla factories? The robots are coming. Is your portfolio ready?
Why is Tesla looking for approval to invest in xAI? 

What are the true operational/strategic drivers to put this to a shareholder vote? In our view, it can’t be just about the money.

What will Elon Musk do if he doesn’t get the $1tn comp package approved? 

Tesla is developing dual-purpose military-grade AI tech in their consumer products.
When do we see Starlink in the cars? We believe it will happen eventually. ‎<This message was edited>

Earnings update risk out the way as Total guided in detail 2 weeks back and CNOOC will update 30 Oct. Former on 9x with 6% divi and 6% buyback. Latter on 5x with 7% divi
